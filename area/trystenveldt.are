The Victory Arch~
A magnificent marble archway spans the roadway before you.  Upon each
side, a grand scene of an epic battle is carved.  On the left, a great
{gwarrior{x sits astride his mount, legs outstretched in the stirrups, and a
{rbloodied{x spear in his hand ready to strike.  On the right, a {rknight{x
in ancient glowing armor stands defensively over the fallen bodies of his
comrades.  The roadway continues north and south.  There is a small alley to

of town houses can be seen to both the north and south, though in the former 
direction the evidence of a thick forest can be detected via more ancient 
trees.  The homes seem to be of a similar design denoting that the same 
architect designed them, all of which hold their own rustic charm.  The 
homes to the south are built against an ancient stone wall, the immediate 
one bearing a brightly painted doorway.

TrystenVeldt Forest~
The overgrown path upon which you stand was once a broad roadway, perhaps
a main thoroughfare leading directly to the victory arch to the south. 
However, the old roadway narrows to nothing more than a pebbly path a few

path, while further into the forest, branches of ancient gnarly trees reach
longingly into the sky.  The path continues north and south.

places they are whole, others broken and falling down.  The battlement forms
a boundary against which the path diverges.

you, one of dread and death.  Horrible images flood past your eyes, of

glazed is laid across the front of the hearth, protecting the hardwood
flooring of the room from the spray of sparks from the fire.  The

Hung above the mantelpiece, you observe a decorative {Ywood carving{x,
apparently scavenged from an old piece of furniture, most likely.  You
notice similar scavenged carvings hung about the room, and realize the owner
must have an interest in ancient carvings.  A sofa, upholstered in

The salon~
The salon is long and broad in dimensions, and appears to be used for
entertaining guests.  The main area of the room is clear of furnishings and
rugs, and the scuff marks on the wooden floor indicate that a ball has been
held here recently.  High-backed upholstered chairs line the walls, which
are paneled and painted with delicate scenes of knight errantry.  A large
musical instrument of beautiful construction and curious appearance stands
at the near end of the room.  The dining area is to the north.

A huge dining table occupies the entire length of the room.  Counting
chairs, you realize it seats at least 50 guests without crowding.  A huge
centrepiece of dried flowers graces the middle of the table, and tapered
candles in gold candlesticks are placed evenly along the length.  A swinging

red wine rather than beer.  There is a door to the east leading to the

This room is quite plain and lacking in warmth or decorative features of

general repairs, candle making, filling lamps and the like.  Tools for the

to discern the painted faces other than as darkened shades and shadows.  A
narrow stairwell leads down from the back hallway and to the south you can

The Master Bedroom~
Windows set into the north and south walls of this chamber permit an 
unobstructed view of the outside world, should one desire such.  Curtains of 
a pastel green have been hung upon brass poles to either side of the 
windows, ready to be drawn or opened at the whim of the owner.  Against the 
eastern wall is a large, carved four-poster bed thick drape of green velvet 
hanging from its structure.  To either side of the bed are nightstands upon 
which candles, jugs and bowls are placed.  The only exit appears to be a 
dark wooden door set in the western wall.

A Studio~
Canvases lean against the walls of this room, some showing completed 
watercolors while others are still in the process of construction.  An easel 
stands close to the northern window with a stool and a small table close by. 
Upon the table's top, small slabs of dried paint can be seen along with 
water and brushes for this craft.  A door of dark stained wood in the 
eastern wall appears to be the only exit from this chamber.  The scent of 
the forest seems to fill this room, seeming to hint that the window is 
normally left ajar while the artist is at work.

A Tasteful Hall~
This hallway is very orderly and is decorated in shades of grey.  The floor 
has been laid with hexagonal tiles that vary between white and black marble 
like a chess board.  Each tile shows ribbons of its opposite color that look 
rather intriguing.  The archways leading to the east, west, and north are 
outlined in black wood that fails to reflect the light of the various 
candelabras and chandelier that have been tastefully placed to illuminate 
most nooks and crannies with a gentle ambience.  An elegant and sturdy table 
made of the same black wood found on the archways and the door leading out 
at the south is here, decorated with a small vase and a single white rose.

An Artful Dining Kitchen~
Finely crafted cupboards of black oak line the northern wall and part of the 
eastern and southern walls, their crystalline handles glistening slightly in 
the light.  The northern half has been converted into a preparation pit for 
food and sports its own little island that is inset with drawers.  A 
fireplace has been crammed in amongst all the other useful contraptions 
designed for functionality in the kitchenette, above which is an iron box 
used as an oven.  A large table made of the same wood is flanked by half a 
dozen chairs, their surfaces carved with elegant curves and scrollwork.  
Each chair is padded with black leather that shines dully in the light 
thrown by the candelabras upon the table.  The centerpiece is adorned with 
at least a dozen white roses that surround a single blood red flower of the 
same type.

In the Parlor~
A square plush rug made of a myriad of greys is at the center of this 
spacious chamber.  Arranged in a square around the middle are several chairs 
and couches which are made of black velvet with white silk rope as trim.  
The very center of this arrangement is completed by a black wooden table 
that sits low and is perfect for resting drinks, packages, and feet upon.  
At the center of the table is a well-attended bouquet of blood red roses.  A 
large fireplace has been built into the west wall with a window stretching 
away above it.  A rope that is coiled up and attached to the same wall is 
used to draw the heavy black velvet curtains open and closed.  The walls and 
floor are made of the same classy black wood as the decorative table, the 
surfaces left unpolished and failing to reflect light.  A few candelabras 
full of candles send forth a flickering light to compensate whenever 
necessary.  A black oak archway leads away to the east.

A Tasteful Hall~
Black and white marble tiles have been laid in a checkerboard pattern over 
the floor, their hexagonal cut fitting perfectly with the slates surrounding 
them.  A double set of doors lead away to the north, the black oak wood set 
with multiple pains of beveled glass that are not at all hidden by the gauzy 
white curtains draped over them.  An archway with well-fitted doors of the 
same dark wood are set in the eastern wall, the double doors one indicator 
of the grandeur of whatever lies beyond.  Settled in the corner near the 
archway that leads to more hall at the south is a small table that holds a 
crystalline statue.

Inscribed along the base of the pegasus statue are the words:

A Luxurious Bath~
Hexagonal tiles have been placed in a chess board pattern over the floor, 
their white and black marbled surfaces veined in their inverse.  The bath is 
made of the lighter marble that makes up the decor of this room, the inside 
of which has a few steps to provide seating at the side of this pool-sized 
structure.  A few round stool-shaped slabs of marble can be seen towards the 
middle of the bath as well, presumably to provide additional resting places. 
The water within the tub steams slightly in this chilly chamber, the moist 
heat giving off a pleasant scent akin to the smell of lavender.  Stone rails 
have been attached to the wall, their close parallelism perfect for keeping 
the fluffy white and black towels that are currently resting upon them.  The 
walls are mirrored, casting romantacised reflections with the aid of the 
candle-laden chandelier.  A small line in the eastern wall shows where the 
way out can be found.

A Bedroom of Great Luxury~
A thick carpet made with a curious mixture of greys graces the floor here, 
keeping it pleasant to walk upon even on the coldest of nights.  A grate 
covers the fireplace set into the eastern wall, preventing hot embers from 
coming in contact with the plush rug.  A bed in the shape of a hexagon 
dominates the center of this chamber, its black oakwood edges inset with 
poles that hold up a velvet-swathed trellis.  Cords are attached to the 
bannisters to allow for the black curtains to be pulled back and expose the 
richly decorated mattresses within, including the silks, velvets, and a few 
dozen throw pillows.  Flowers mingled with very dim lights have been woven 
through the trelliswork supported by the bedframe, providing the recumbant 
inhabitants something of moderate interest to look at.  A three-pane mirror 
set up to form half of a hexagon can be seen toward the southern wall, an 
oriental-style screen made of black oak wood finishing the shape elegantly.  
Two blackened doors lead away to the west.

oriental-style screen~
White rice paper has been attached to the hollowed panels of this screen.  
The wood has been carved with flowing curves and scrollwork of great 
meticulousness while the rice papers have black lotus flower shapes 
decorating their stark whiteness.  This pretty screen provides excellent 
protection from any would-be perverts that would watch the master or 
mistress dress.

A Large Garden~
Small flagstone paths lead around this large garden, weaving around small 
mounds of bright flowers and a raised marble fountain dais, its basin 
looking large enough to be used as a swimming pool.  The scent of the 
flowers that are in one stage of bloom or another mixes to form a pleasant 
aroma that hangs in the air here.  Thick groves of trees mark the boundaries 
of this garden, the small communities of trees dominated by both apple and 
cherry laden sentinels.  Ivy climbs several trellises that arch over the 
flagstone paths at regular intervals, their star shaped leaves a mix of blue 
and green.  Neatly kept rose bushes mix in with these creeping plants, their 
red and white roses seeming to be perfect blooms that are usually spotted 
with dew.  Statues of tree stumps with chipmunks and squirrels on and around 
them fill out the small courtyards that the concourses make when they 
converge.  Two doors full of small beveled windows lead into the sizely 
estate to the south.

A Floral Chamber~
A doorway to the south opens directly into this reasonably sized living room 
which has been decorated with a flower patterned paper and chairs bearing 
the same floral design.  Windows set into the south wall show a busy roadway 
over which another residence is plainly visible.  The window in the north 
most wall shows a small garden behind which is a dense forest.  Stairs lead 
upwards from this chamber, set into the northwestern wall so as not to get 
in the way, while a door in the eastern wall appears to lead to a second 
room.

A Cozy Kitchen~
Paper depicting various herbs has been placed about this chamber, adding to 
the feel that this is a kitchen, a feeling that is firmly supported by a 
large stove and the various implements needed to prepare or eat a meal.  A 
window in the southern wall looks over a small garden which terminates in a 
forest.  Under this window a sink has been placed so that anyone doing the 
washing up has a pleasing view.

patterned sheets that compliment the wallpaper that adorns these walls.  A 
small doorway leads to the east, upon which has been painted a stylized 
design of a chamber pot.  Windows in the northern and southern wall look out 
into either the street if one looks to the south or into the forest or 
garden if one should look out of the northern one.  Thick curtains have been 
placed to either side of the windows, hanging from curtain rods so that they 
may be opened or closed upon a whim.

A Cozy Bathroom~
A small bathroom has been fashioned here including a sink, bath and water 
closet, the latter must presumably empty outside into some concealed 
cesspit.  The bath is far from large, most likely no greater in length that 
five feet, but it does appear to be comfortable enough and there is 
certainly plenty of fresh linen and towels for any who should exit the 
contraption.  The scent of rosemary fills the air, most likely a product of 
the various soaps, lotions and balms that have been scattered about this 
chamber.  A doorway to the west appears to be the only method of egress for 
a person.

Fluted pillars of blue veined marble stretch up to the high ceiling of this 
chamber having been placed in each corner of this spacious room.  Hanging 
from the center of the painted ceiling is a masterly crafted chandelier 
which refracts light into a shimmering rainbow of colors upon the floor.  
Twin stain glass windows set into the northern wall either side of a set of 
ivy carved double doors send pools of light over the marble floor and 
towards the fountain that bubbles in the center of the room.  In the 
southern wall a brass-bound pair, of wooden doors have been set within an 
archway.

Polished walnut panels cover the floor and walls of this room, the rich, 
warm luster seeming to add to the warmth of the atmosphere here.  Crafted 
into the south-western corner of the room is a small stage, crystal covered 
lighting set into so as to subtly illuminate the performers.  In the 
north-eastern corner a low bar stands, the counter crafted from the same 
material as the floor and walls.  Three groups of tables and chairs sit 
around the center of the room large enough to accommodate six people a 
piece.  Slowly spinning orbs of magical fire dangle from the roof within 
prisons of beveled glass, giving there radiance to this chamber.  Double 
doors stand to the south and north while a wrought iron spiraling staircase 
leads upwards to the second floor.

crafted from polished walnut, buffed to a fine luster, while the ceiling has 
been artfully painted.  Racking upon the walls holds countless, fluffy, 
towels in all colors and a pair of small covered bins stand against the 
northern wall waiting for used towels to be placed within.

southern wall of the room.  A low trough runs down the center of the room 
holding ladles and water while all four walls are bedecked with slatted 
benches for the occupants to rest comfortably upon.  Warmth fills this 
chamber like a drowsy fog making most movement seem like too much effort.  
To the west a pine door has been set.

sedately upwards.  Set upon the soft moss covered floor are a few ornately 
crafted hard wooden benches.  Lush green trees form a natural barrier about 
this clearing protecting it from the elements, beneath which bright 
flowering blossoms grow in abundance.

This chamber has been fashioned from bog oak and carved by a skillful hand 
and an artful mind.  Ivy leaves appear to leap from the rafters and walls, 
climbing their way around the room, from within these mock plants small 
animals and the occasional sprite can be seen, peeking into the boudoir.  
Standing in the center of the room is a large four-poster bed, the curtains 
and silken sheeting fashioned from burgundy fabric.  Soft lightly pools 
about this area from a delicate quartz fitting set into the high ceiling, 
the light throwing rainbows onto the walls and floor.  To the south a 
paneled door is set.

boards of the floor before the fireplace is a thick, silky pelt of some 
black and white striped beast its natural luster shimmering in the light 
from the fire.  The only furnishings within this chamber are a low fur 
covered bed and a couched of deep blue velvet.  Carvings upon the wall when 
coupled with the fire light give this chamber an almost cave like feel to 
it, this is added to when the northern door way is considered which, from 
this side, looks like the mouth of a cave.
