a cook~
A cook is here, putting together a freshly cooked meal.
~
This man is an expert at cooking and arranging the many meals served at
this establishment.  The cook is small but quick, adept at staying out of

dish out before it is burned.  His clothes fit, his hat is snug, and his
shoes are made for long hours on his feet.

peacekeeper guard keeper man~
a peacekeeper~
A large peacekeeper stands here, watching for public disturbances.
~
Before you is a peacekeeper of Utopia.  Those assigned to guard the city
streets, peacekeepers have a tendency to look the other way when it comes to
all but the most violent crimes.  The large man has seen few such conflicts,
but is by no means inexperienced, as only seasoned warriors are accepted
into the ranks of the Utopian guard.  These guards come from various
backgrounds, however, including crusaders, city guards, mercenaries, and
bandits.

a field hand~
A poor field hand returns home from a hard day's work.
~
This man is wearing almost everything he owns.  The ragged shirt and
tattered jeans were his personal sacrifice made in order to put his family
into even a primitive shelter.  The worn hoe he holds in hands now succumbs
to the purpose of walking stick as he walks exhausted to what little rest he
does get.

~
This rat is large and most definitely ugly.  Fur has been torn out of its
hide in large blotches, leaving pink scars that appear huge when held in
relation to the rat itself.  The beady eyes of the rodent are not very
alert, but its nose always twitches.  It has a sharp tone to its movement,
and a sharper edge to its teeth.

homeless unfortunates man~
one of the city's unfortunates~
A homeless man wanders aimlessly, looking for something for dinner.
~
This man was dubbed by the overseers too weak to work the fields. 
Unmarried and cast from his job, it was not long before the unfortunate
individual was unable to afford his home any longer, and hence he has ended
up homeless, living in the sewers, where at least it is most times dry.  He
smells of rats and sewage, his clothes are burnt, tattered, and dirty, and
there is grime covering his face.

A short gray snake slithers through the water.
~
This short snake roams the sewers looking for rats to feed off upon.  The
snake is an average swimmer, and moves almost as rapidly on land.  Though
not poisonous, the short snake is suffocating the smaller rats through
constriction, and repeated puncture wounds from serrated fangs.

{RA message from Royal Maglos:
 
The haitorin known as Keiran is charged with murder, intent to murder,
threats against the Utopian populace to that end, and threats of theft
towards the Utopian people.  I will not let this stand.  The haughty
thief believes he can challenge a whole Realm and expect us all to
give in.  I say no--I say that if you all unite firmly behind me, we
can rid ourselves of this plague of theft and murder forever.

If he is declaring war by himself against Utopia, then I declare war on
him, with all of the forces of Utopia.  I ask that you, the people,
join me against this rabble-rouser and we shall be forever rid of

Doriah's Tailor~
This shop was named after the legendary utopian princess Doriah, who was
allegedly the fairest maiden to walk the southern continent.  Though perhaps
a bit outclassed, the resident tailor tries her best to live up to the
legend.  Here it is possible to order hand made coats and dresses.  In fact,
she even cobbles.

Near the Shore~
The water here is shallow.  Should you choose to submerge yourself it
rises up to your neck.  To the south can be seen a sliver of land which
stretches from horizon to horizon.  This new continent is still very far
away, but you can tell by the color of the water that the depth remains the
same up until you reach the shore.  This is convenient for you, but it makes
for impossible sailing for larger vessels.

steel, or some sort of similar metal, and has been built in the shape of a
large circle.  It stands in the center of the large wall which encircles the
city.  The road on which you now travel will take you wither into the city
to the south, or to the sea to the north.

chalky white.  You can tell that to the south the buildings get a bit
smaller than the grand estates along the northern most part of the city. 
They are, however, still quite large.

several shops line the eastern and western sides of the street.  Only two or
three look interesting though, the others sell mainly novelties and
souvenirs to Discordian visitors.  One such peddler seems to have taken up a
home in the street here.

buildings may be smaller on the south side of the circle, the town is much
more populated.  People are constantly traversing up and down the circle,
back and forth from their homes to their workplace.  The buildings are still
moderately large, but you can tell that they are much cheaper, as they are
mostly made of thick wood or light bricks.  The circle continues north and

grandfathers and such.  A large door lies on the wall.

Taking up the center of the room is an ornately crafted table, able to
seat perhaps twenty to thirty people comfortably.  Carved wooden chairs are
in place about the table in order to serve that purpose.  Upon the walls are
large lanterns, hung from iron fixtures that complement the decor of the
room.  Between the lanterns are several paintings of landscapes.

Arriving in this quiet room, it is evident from its design and decor that
this is a very nice home.  The thickly carpeted floor is a deep hunter green
in color, matching perfectly with the walls.  Dark wood runs from the floor,
ending about three feet up the wall where it continues, painted a brilliant
white, to the ceiling.  Entraceways lead south to a large dining room, and
east to a well furnished living room.  A sturdy looking door to the north
leads back out to town, while to the west, a door is visible, leading to the
bedroom.  Spiraling upwards in the center of the room, a black iron
staircase has been placed.  A small library is plainly visible from your
vantage point.

is a bustle of people coming from one way or another, going about their
business be it shopping, or just commuting to the fields.  In the center of
the square is a large marble overhang.  Decorating the monument are four
ornately carved pillars, boasting a large dome at their highest point. 
Under this construct are several benches and a large white fountain which
has cool water running in large quantities.  The crowded Crusader Street
continues to the north and south.  There is also a primitive manhole in the
ground.

proudest neighborhood in the world.  The houses here are small one room
clunkers which would, if not for the loving care of those who live within
them, look like boxes with fancy tops.  As it is though, the people keep
their houses quite nice.  Even on their scant salaries, they somehow manage
to keep them well kept.

Unless you intend to duck into one of these, you may travel only east and

world holds save for those who have explored it?  A large gate made of
wrought iron is located to the north, leading the way to a magnificent arena
which is accessible through a large tunnel in the wall.  The gate itself
connects to a large wall that you barely even noticed before.  The wall
stretches east and west, hugging the southern side of the city right up to
the mountain ranges on either side.  The safety of the city, of course, lies
still east and west.

perhaps the door was a portal.  The room is decorated with magical tools and

You stand now on Stave Lane, a road used for the purpose of transporting
the citizens of Utopia to where they work in the fields.  This road is not
as large as Crusader Street, but it is a good deal longer.  It travels east
and west the entire breadth of the valley in which Utopia sits.  An ominous
tower looms to the north.

At first the mountains look completely inhospitable, but further
inspection shows that there are some homes higher up within them.  In any
case, this road's only purpose is to take you to the fields, which lie still
west of here.

At the end of Stave Lane lies the fields, and they are now directly north
and south from here.  From here it is possible to see many people working
with the animals.  Also, a trail can be seen heading up the mountains in the
west to the village on the cliffs.  Stave Lane continues east.

Stave Lane may not be as wide or well used as Crusader Street, but it is
a great deal longer.  The road travels east and west with the purpose of
getting people from Crusader Street to their jobs in the fields, and you can
tell by the worn surface of the road that it does this job very well.  In
the distance to the east and west can be seen large sets of fields where the
Utopian people work, herding animals to make some meagre earnings.  Crusader
street lies directly west of here.

From this point in Stave Lane, the mountains on the eastern side of this
valley are especially visible.  These mountains mark the ending point of the
fields beyond this road, but the road itself ends long before the fields
begin.  Crusader Street is now a good distance away to the west.

At this point in Stave lane the road ends, and the fields begin.  The
fields stretch out north, south, and east from here.  In the distance you
can see many herd animals grazing on the cool sweet grass of the lush
fields, and many shepherds and herders are also visible, doing their jobs
tending to the animals.  Stave Lane continues back to the west, where it
eventually meets up with Crusader Street and then more fields.

The Temple of Utopia~
You stand now within the temple of Utopia.  This temple was erected long
ago so the native people of the land could serve their ancient god of
creation.  The entrance to the temple is made up of a large archway that
leads into a room with a high ceiling.  From this point in the temple, you
can choose to go one of three ways.  To the north lies the altar, while two
other archways lie east and west.

altar itself is made up of a large clam shell set on a pedestal and bordered
on either by what look like two golden wedges.  The room is spacious, but
very much enclosed.  The exit of the temple can be seen to the south.  There
is also a small grate on the floor.

This room has been dictated a prayer room for those needing help with
their animals or loved ones.  People come from all over the city to pray in
this place, as it is known to be one of the holiest around.  The room itself
is quite small.  The doorway was large, but now a low ceiling prevents
unrestricted movement.  The rest of the temple lies to the east.

This is the end of Crusader Street.  The wide road ends in a marketplace
of sorts.  Though there are no significant vendors selling their wares in
the street, several shops can be seen lining the east and west sides of the
road.  Crowning the southern side of the street is a large wooden building,
most likely an inn or a tavern, which stands a good two floors up.  The rest
of Crusader Street lies still to the north.

This shop proves to be an emporium of tastes.  The grocer has gone above
and beyond the call of the typical food supplier and stocks dozens of exotic
fruits, thirteen kinds of bread, and much more.  Rows of food are lined up
in the store, and none know them better than the merchant himself.

The Traveler's Rest Inn~
This place is a safehaven for adventurers, and a place of rest for the
weary.  Tables and chairs are set up for casual conversation and a bit of
casual dining.  The Traveler's Rest Inn is famed throughout Utopia for being
the best place to get a strong drink and a good night's sleep.  Upon
entering the inn, travellers are confronted with a menagerie of sights as
sounds.  On the western wall is the entrance to the kitchen, while a piano
is situated on the eastern wall which is used occasionally to provide
limited entertainment, or perhaps to cover up some of the more important
conversations which take place within these walls.  Travelling south will
bring you to a small staircase which leads up to the second floor of the
inn, where rooms can be purchased by the more regular customers.  The door
to Crusader Street lies once again to the north.  It is always open.

floor has been put a carpet, two tables stand in the center of the room, and
six cots sit along the walls for the comfort of those who choose to spend
time here.  The common room of the inn was designed to be a place where
multiple adventurers could spend their time, discuss their travels, and take
the heavy load off of their feet.

The Utopian Sewers~
The sewers of Utopia are made up entirely of shale slabs brought up from
the quarry.  The smell is bad, but could be worse, as iron grates were put
into the design plan to provide limited ventilation into the soil above. 
The sewers are dark and cold.  There's no telling what lives around here.

the quarry.  The smell is bad, but could be worse, as iron grates were put
into the design plan to provide limited ventilation into the soil above. 
The sewers are dark and cold.  There's no telling what lives around here.

{GP{Yalace Road~
The larger homes of Utopia Circle open up here to reveal the city palace.
The enormous building is new in relation to others of its kind, the size of
the building being the truly impressive part.  The palace is almost as big
as a castle.  The road itself stretches only a small ways to the palace. 
The building lies directly south.

Before the Palace of Utopia~
You stand now Before the Palace of Utopia.  Though the huge doors usually
stand closed, most are typically welcomed into the forward rooms of the
palace.  From closer up the palace looks a small bit less impressive than it
did at a distance, but it is still a titanic structure.  Palace Road leads
back to the north.

Endio's Custom Metalworking~
This metalworking shop is large and airy.  The high ceiling is vented to
allow the hot air wafting up from the forge to escape outside.  The stone
walls are decorated with many different types of weapons and armor, each
unique in its own way.  A large counter with a single wooden stool behind it
blocks your progress into the rear of the store, behind it long metal
counters run along each wall for working on the many different types of
metal.  Taking up the majority of the rear space, a large stone forge has
been constructed, the raging fire inside giving off a breathtaking heat. 
Along the northern wall, a single door leads outside, the busy streets of
Utopia visible beyond it.

A Small Library~
The first thing you notice when you arrive is the aroma of cider that
permeates the air.  Looking around, you notice that this entire room is
lined with shelves made from that wood, indicating the source of the
wonderful smell.  Magical lights float gently above your head on the
ceiling, gently illuminating the entire area.  The only break in the
shelving is on the wall to the south, allowing for a large picture window. 
The view out the window is of the city, spreading over the canvass made of
glass in a beautiful display.  The cider shelves are packed full with books
of various size and age, though all appear to be well preserved and cared
for.  The middle of the floor is broken only by a desk, made from the same
material as the shelves, that is arranged facing away from the window. 
Plush chairs are set facing each other in front of the desk and a small
table resides in between them.  A small iron staircase spirals the way down,
back to the main part of the house.

A Small Dining Room~
This small room has been decorated as a dining room.  Dominating the
center of the area, a round table large enough to seat five people has been
placed.  Covering the floor is a thick green carpeting, stretching from wall
to wall.  The walls are made of wood from the floor to about three feet up,
proceeding from there to the ceiling and painted a brilliant white.  A door
to the north leads to a small foyer, while the kitchen is visible to the
west.

A Large Bedroom~
This large bedroom appears to be a very comfortable place to sleep.  The
floor is covered in dark green carpeting which matches perfectly with the
walls.  Dark wood runs from the floor to about three feet up the wall,
continuing to the ceiling in a brilliant white.  A large four poster bed has
been placed against the southern wall, appearing to be very comfortable. 
The eastern wall is home to a large window, allowing a view outside of the
house.  A door to the north leads to the living room, while a doorway to the
west leads to the bath.

A Living Kitchen~
This room has been designed and setup as a kitchen.  Spacious and roomy,
the floors are covered in dark green tiles and run from wall to wall.  Dark
green tiles climb the walls, about half-way up before turning into a
brilliant white surface, and continuing to the ceiling.  A large window on
the southern wall allows a view of a patch of wildflowers which seem to
always be in bloom.  Under the window, a large sink has been placed with a
faucet, allowing running water to come directly in.  Pushed up against the
western wall is a stove, big enough to easily cook for four.  Pots and pans
line the wall to either side of it, hanging on hooks.  A single doorway
leads the way to the east, back to the dining room.

This bathroom is covered in alternating white and green tiles that cover
the floor and walls.  A lavish tub has been built into the western wall,
occupying nearly half of the space in the room.  The bath itself is large
enough to comfortably hold three people, with room for a fourth.  A ledge
has been built around the sides, as though to make a place for you to sit,
submerged.  A sink on the northern wall provides a place for you to wash
your hands and face, and is a pale green color.  A doorway to the east leads
the way back to the bedroom.

A vast open cavern seems to have been made out of a bubble of volcanic
rock.  The round black ceiling and walls are very hard and thin, and just
barely breakable.  The cold rock floor is coated with a dark slime.
