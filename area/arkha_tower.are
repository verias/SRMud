way.  It has been drained of its desire to live, and now feeds on this

stand out on its own, it would stick out very visibly, but as it is, its
lumpy back enables it to blend in with the cave wall quite well.  As it
swings its large claws, you can see bony knuckles which would do damage on
their own without the razor sharp claws attached.

large clubs in battle.  He is tall, and almost lanky in comparison to his
size, but looking twice you realize that it is his lack of body fat which
makes him appear so.  He looks hungry, skin pulled taut across his features.

he is the one who dug the small tunnel leading to this larger one.

the Black Guivre~
A huge black worm snarls at you.
~
Before you is an enormous worm.  Similar to a long dragon, except without
limbs, the guivre makes for a terrible looking adversary.  Black scales
cover his entire body, and his eyes and tongue are likewise extremely dark. 
Fangs extend from his upper jaw to protrude below his lower when his mouth
closes, but since it unhinges, the long teeth are not much trouble for him.

randomly appear in a jumbled position, jump back into the air, and then
flash back out of the mortal realm, emerging themselves in the planar
fabric.  The blue horrors have death in their eyes.

happy monks.  Arkha is a tall man, dressed in white robes, but with a very

The Path~
You have come across a small path leading north.  This trail leads north and 
south, to some unseen destination.  Actually, now that you think about it, 
you can just see a small tower looming from between the dense forest in the 
distance.  A short distance off to the east a compressed earthen roadway can 
be seen, winding its way through the forest like a giant brown snake.

there is a drapery with a crest indicating that the tower belongs to the

The Great Hall~
You have come to the part of the great hall used as for banquets and
other general matters where it is customary for guests to take a seat.  The
walls of the hall here are lined with enormous tables and benches.  The
arrangement, though somewhat of an eyesore, looks to be very effective.

The Great Hall~
The walls of the great hall reflect the jubilant spirit of the rest of
the place perfectly.  They are covered with large drapes baring the crest of
the Arkha monks, along with the occasional sword and shield pair that is
frequently seen in places such as this.  You stand now in the south west
corner of the tower.  The exit lies to the east, while more of the great
hall is to the north.

The Great Hall~
You stand now in the southeast corner of the tower of the Arkha monks. 
This corner seems rather forgotten as opposed to the others, as the
arrangement hints that there are seldom very many people back here.  The
north wall stretches on to the north of here, while to the east lies the
tower exit.

is quite thin.  The south door, however, is made out of a heavy mahogany,
and looks to have been very expensive.  The hallway itself continues east

journey easier, but you still tire quickly after going up this many steps. 
Above you you can make out a doorway in the top of the tower.

gazebo can be found a small opening leading to a very long stairwell and the
rest of the tower.  You may travel in any cardinal direction from here.

in the center of the area, and surrounding the table are three ornately
carved chairs.  A delicately woven rug lies under this set.  On the western
wall lies a beautiful painting of a waterfall cascading down a great cliff. 
You can travel in the north, east, and south directions from here.

frequent visitors which belong to his order.  On the north wall of the room
lies a large chair, upon which is a plush red cushion.  A carpet leads from
the little gazebo to the south directly to this throne of sorts, which is
where you would guess the High Monk spends most of his time.

This place would appear to be a washroom of some sort.  From a sort of
pipe on the ceiling of the room comes a steady stream of clean, cool water
which runs down the privy and out of the back of the tower.  The device is
strange to you, and you find yourself wondering how the water comes to the
top of the tower.

around the table, ready for use whenever they are needed.

You have come to a quarry of sorts, but it appears to be for relics as
opposed to rocks.  All around the room can be seen ancient crests and
shields, along with other artifacts that the monks have collected.  Just
because the monks are nonviolent and cheerful doesn't mean they lack
security, though, as all of these things of value are anchored somehow to
the wall.

two are designed for a slow boil.  The air still smells of the last meal.

lamp which is powered by a tiny candle.  This room looks like it would make
a very comfortable place to rest.

impossible to move, it was impossible to escape.  You decide that you would

ground that the haitorin appears to have been working on.

The walls are made of hard rock but they have eroded to create jagged edges,
and the wooden supports have rotted clean through, leaving the friction on
the outside of the building the only thing holding it up.  The torches are
still fresh, however.  They look as if someone has been tending them.

at one time belonged to someone of great importance, as the size of the
building is more than reasonable and the purple rags which lie about the
room were undoubtedly at one time drapes and other decorations.  Also, along
the walls can be seen the remains of decorative full body armor, probably
jostled to the ground by the impact when the house ended its descent into
the earth.  Few still stand.

left.  A hole under the steps looks large enough to fit through.

The Back of the Lighted Room~
This room has been torn along the south wall and now sits incomplete up
against one side of the cavern.  It appears to have been the entrance to the
house at one time because the door sits open against the side of the cave,
pinned there by its own hinges.  The incomplete door now resembles a simple
gap.  There is just enough room to fit through.

A Lighted Room~
Again stalagmites block you from travelling any further in the direction
you were heading.  This time, however, they are in the center of the room. 
The stalagmites stretch so far upward that were the ceiling not so high,
they would go strait through the building.

A Lighted Room~
You find yourself now in another corner of this strange room, though this
one was most likely not in the original construction design.  It looks like
the falling home came to rest on a large stalagmite.  The stalagmite is
there now, blocking your passage southward.

A Lighted Room~
You are now in the corner of the lighted room.  This room appears to have
at one time belonged to someone of great importance, as the size of the
building is more than reasonable and the purple rags which lie about the
room were undoubtedly at one time drapes and other decorations.  Also, along
the walls can be seen the remains of decorative full body armor, probably
jostled to the ground by the impact when the house ended its descent into
the earth.  Few still stand.

Outside the Lighted House~
You stand directly outside of the lighted house.  Before you now is a
large cavern which once extended to form a large dome.  Currently, the dome
has been cut short, and now lies as a wedge, only a sliver of what it once
was.

Outside the Lighted House~
As you travel north from here, the tiny cavern in which you are forced to
travel gradually gets larger and larger.  The walls of this cavern appear to
be made not of limestone, but of some kind of volcanic substance.  Covering
these walls is a softly glowing moss, which provides light enough to see by.

You now have enough space to move around freely.  Looking back at the
lighted house, you can now see the outside quite freely.  Pinned between the
roof of the house and the cavern ceiling is a purple banner baring the crest
of Arkha.  Apparently this Arkha was a lord at some point.

A Large Cave~
The area around you has finally opened up enough as to be called a
cavern.  Looking up, you can see that the mysterious lighted building
actually does have a second floor, but it is impossible to enter because the
building has no windows.  Apart from this fact you cannot seem to find much
of interest.  You may travel east and south from here.

north side of the cavern.  On that wall can be seen a large hole leading
further into the cave.

frequent use has battered the bottom of the tunnel flat.  The tunnel travels

A Vast Room~
The large room you are now in is dark and confusing.  There is a heavy
mist which coats the ground, but you are still able to see.  Your mind seems
to play tricks on you, as you constantly see the shadows move from out of
the corner of your eye and you hear strange footsteps echoing through the
room with no hint of an origin.  Also, the large pillars which hold up the
room seem to be moving further and further away.  This place is strange
indeed.

A Vast Room~
You find yourself still travelling in this enormous room.  All around you
the room is coated with a blanket of fog, and the pillars are now closer
than ever.  In fact, were you not a sane individual you would swear that
they were fleeing from you.  Travelling is fortunately still easy, but as
you walk you frequently glimpse motions in the shadows and strange noises
can be heard coming from the ends of the room.

The {BDark Room~
You are now in a small dark room.  The walls on every side of you are
black as night, and there is very little space for you here.  To the south,
the room opens up into a small tunnel.

The {BDark Passageway~
You now travel in a short dark tunnel which leads north and south.  The
walls on all sides are black.  As you walk, the passageway opens up more and
more.  This tunnel looks to have been built, but it seems strangely natural
as well.

The Constructed Cavern~
You stand now in the center of a large cavern.  This place is strange, it
looks natural, but its perfect geometric shape hints that it is not.  The
cavern has a heavy smell of decay, similar to that of a tomb or a set of
catacombs.  The scent burns in your nostrils.

The Constructed Cavern~
You still travel within this enormous constructed cavern.  The room is so
big, and the walls are so black, that were it not for the repulsing smell,
you would likely forget that you were inside at all.  The smell remains,
however, a reminder to keep vigilant.  There's no telling what secrets this
cavern keeps.

The Corner of the Cavern~
You are now in the corner of this cavern.  The walls and ceiling may be
black, but the ground is made of earth, and is clearly visible to you from
here.  On the ground in the very corner can be seen the most likely reason
for this strong scent in the air, as a single bone sits, deprived of the
flesh which once covered it.  Your travel is limited, but you may still
continue.

You stand before a large wall on the back of the cavern.  These walls are
so black that you can scarcely believe that they are even there.  Even when
you touch them, no mark remains.  The smell in the air is less potent than
before, but it still lingers, a constant reminder that you stand on a burial
ground.

The Wall of the Cavern~
This is a side wall to the constructed cavern.  Approaching the wall is
like trying to find a door while blindfolded.  The wall is so black that you
have no choice other than to grope at thin air for it.  The stench in the
air is still strong, but you can tell that it gets stronger as you travel to
the center of the cave.

You can tell now that this cavern is definitely man made.  The light in
the room refracts off of the ceiling in such a way that you can see the
octagons of black rock used to make the roof quite clearly.  Also, a pile of
the black rock lies on the ground by your feet.  It is round and soft,
proving the blunt shape of the ceiling artificial.

Piles of the rocks used to construct the cavern lie along the walls here.
It appears that when enough of them cultivate, the rocks actually seem to
absorb the light around them.  The rocks appear to be covering something,
but the stacks are so large that you cannot uncover whatever it is.  The
smell is especially strong here, however, and you find yourself wondering
whether or not the two are related.

A Repulsing Mound~
Piled in the center of this place is a mound of carcasses.  Your worst
suspicions are confirmed as your eyes catch this grisly scene.  This cavern
has definitely been built as a burial ground of some sort.  It sickens you
to think of just how many bodies must be in this stack alone.  You find
yourself wanting to flee to the east or the west.

whatever lies south of here.  On the walls are two small notches once used
to bare torches, but which now lie empty.  You can continue south.

The Long Hall~
You have emerged into an enormous hallway.  This place is fantastic,
everything is huge.  In this central part of the hallway, you walk on a
large red carpet.  Ten gigantic columns line this part of the hall,
sufficiently separating it from the walls.  A shiver runs down your spine as
you see a monstrous dagger resting on the ground.

a dark hole.  Looking around, you notice that all the fancy decor of the
hallway has vanished, only to be replaced by an unkept mess of a stone
passageway.  As you stand, a gust of cold air rushes at you from the pit
below.

The Long Hall~
You stand now in the corner of this long hallway.  On the walls can be
seen hanging gigantic weapons and enormous suits of armor, but all of it
seems rusted by misuse and the moisture in the air.  Occasionally you think
you hear the sound of metal on metal, but nothing ever seems to move.

The Long Hall~
The wall of this hallway is by no means less decorated than the rest of
the room.  Red and black drapes hang from the ceiling and several metal
weapons rest on giant pegs.  These weapons are far to heavy to carry.  More
lie on the walls to the north and south.

The Huge Door~
On the west wall here lies a huge door.  The door is made of a solid
metal which is harder than iron by far.  You would not be able to even budge
it were the door latched, but luckily it stands partially ajar.  Beside the
door rests one gigantic boot, and propped up upon it is a sword of equal
proportions.  Gazing into the distance you can see that the setup is the
same across the hall.

You are now in an extremely well decorated room.  On the ceiling are
crystal chandeliers, on the wall are huge draperies and life-size portraits,
on the floor is a red and black striped carpet.  On the west well high above
your reach is a bowl which holds a large flame.  It burns brightly but
safely inside its metal constraints.

The Tunnel Entrance~
You have entered a dark tunnel system running under the long hall.  The
air here is very moist, making the floor slippery and the walls always wet. 
The tunnels appear to be natural, made of a hard, sharp, volcanic rick.  In
the distance you can here the skittering of claws on stone, but other then
that, the tunnel is quiet.

A Turn in the Tunnel~
The tunnel turns sharply here, changing direction quite quickly. 
Thankfully, the water on the walls in combination with the brightness of
your light causes a bright reflection off of the tunnel walls, making
visibility actually quite good.  The silence is accompanied only by
momentary breaks for the sound of subtle movements far off within the cave.

plenty of places where one could hide themselves.

particular religious facility is draped in deep red and black.  There are no

altar sits before the north wall, but other then that the room seems empty. 
A large black door can be seen standing open on the south side of the room.

This strange dirt road is unique in that it travels through a community
built completely underground.  The Necroth City was built entirely within a
dome of a cavern over a mile under the surface.  The road itself is not made
actually of dirt, but of a black dust which sits on everything around here
that stays stationary for any amount of time.  The road travels in a circuit
around the small city.

The Dirt Road~
The road you are now on travels the inner perimeter of the entire Necroth
city.  Staying constantly just within the outer ring of buildings, whose
backs face the wall of the enormous cavern, the road is the chief method of
transit for every being in the city.  The soft black dust makes for easy
travelling.

dome of a cavern over a mile under the surface.  The road itself is not made
actually of dirt, but of a black dust which sits on everything around here
that stays stationary for any amount of time.  The road travels in a circuit
around the small city.

The Dirt Road~
The road you are now on travels the inner perimeter of the entire Necroth
city.  Staying constantly just within the outer ring of buildings, whose
backs face the wall of the enormous cavern, the road is the chief method of
transit for every being in the city.  The soft black dust makes for easy
travelling.

You are now in an amply sized home in the Necroth civilization.  As the
Necroth breed in litters of twenty to thirty, the space is needed, but since
they only reproduce once every century or so, the extra space is seldom
used.  The house stretches on into a back room.

Only a handful of Necroth ever survive the training required to be worthy of
the title of warrior.  All of the warriors of the city stay confined to
these barracks at all times, lest a conflict arise and they are not on call.

ceilings give for the illusion of more space yet.  To the south of here can
be seen a large dining room, while to the north lies the dusty street.

Throne throne room itself is not nearly so spacious as the rest of this

finally meeting the pinnacle of the roof of the building, the space in
comparison looks closed in.  The throne is made of a large piece of slate
that curves only so slightly to form the seat, keeping its user in a mostly
upright position.  Whoever stands before this rock holds supreme power over
the Necroth civilization.

The Long Tunnel~
The tunnel you are now travelling in is large and long.  Running north
and south, the darkness keeps you from seeing what lies at its end.  Much
too large to have been made by the effort of most races, the only way that
this loose dirt wall tunnel could have been constructed is by something very
large.

The Long Tunnel~
This wide tunnel is far too large to be hand dug, and was probably made
by a very big creature.  You have room enough in here to stand erect, with
more comfort then the cell from where you originated.  The tunnel runs north
and south, and looks rather long.

A Bubble in the Rock~
You have come to yet another large cavern formed deep within the earth. 
The large vacant area is completely spherical, sloping steeply downward from
this point before smoothing itself out again into a smooth incline before
flattening out completely and heading up the other side.  In the very center
of the sphere can be seen a shiny object.

A Bubble in the Rock~
As you walk along the perimeter of this spherical cave, you notice that
the rocks have a tint of blue to them.  Your original hypothesis was that
this cavern was made as a result of a bubble in liquid magma rock, but as
you have never seen blue igneous rock before, you begin to let your
imagination wander to more radical solutions.

A Bubble in the Rock~
The slope now still leads up and down, but it is no longer very steep. 
As the incline smooths out, so does the terrain, and you find it becoming
more and more difficult to keep yourself from sliding down the slope anyway.
Your only choices in direction are down to level ground, or back up to the
rim once again.

You now stand on level ground.  The floor of this cave can best be
described as disappointing.  The terrain is featureless, the only thing
partially of interest being a metal cube, but it has no openings and is far
too large to be lifted.  The steel object sits motionless, but is somehow
warm.

enough space to hold a shrine or temple.  Being now in the center of the

It would appear that the strange light which you have been draped within
actually originates from the walls of this building.  The glowing walls are
smooth and cold, and completely strait.

The Bottom of the Metal Cube~
You stand now at the very bottom of the metal cube.  Out of the floor
here seems to be growing a large plant.  The plant leafs out and covers the
floor, but the roots have done their damage to the floor of the cube, and a
chunk of the metal has been peeled away, leaving a hole covered by a giant
leaf.

The Silver Pipe~
You have entered a long gleaming vertically running tube.  From somewhere
down below you comes a brilliantly bright light which refracts off the
reflective walls of the place which form into one long concave mirror.  You
may travel up or down from this place.

The Lair of the Black Guardian~
The room you are now standing in has become once more enormous.  It is
illuminated with a bright white light which bursts up from a single trapdoor
and shoots up into the room and the pipe beyond.  No crevice is left
untouched by this purifying light.

The Tower Sanctum~
You have reached the bottom of the dungeons under the Arkha Tower, the
Tower Sanctum, dwelling place of great Arkha himself.  On the wall there is
a large parchment which seems to entail the events leading up to Arkha's
imprisonment here.  There are no exits from this little prison, as it is
guarded by strong magic as well as hard steel.

parchment~
This large blanket of a scroll entails the events which resulted in the
monk's containment in this place.  The parchment explains that Arkha was
once a good man, dedicated to making people happy.  In order to lift the
spirits of society, he created a new order, dedicated to sincere joy in
everything around oneself.  This order believed that all events leading up
to death were blessings, and one who sincerely followed its teachings was
never saddened.  Unfortunately, Arkha himself did not believe his own
teachings.  His thoughts were that so long as others lives were improved by
his work, that it was worth the sacrifice of his own personally happiness. 
He wore the masquerade of a happy monk for too long, however, and the false
emotions began to eat at the marrow of his soul, causing him to become
internally angry and hateful.  Seeing this development in his personality
before he was too corrupted to realize what was going on, Arkha Saladorius
faked his death and arranged to be buried under his once beloved tower. 
Once there, he called his mount, a pitch black dragon named Traitet, and
together they made their way down into the depths of a large system of until
then undiscovered caves and ruins before eventually coming to this place. 
Arkha eventually continued his evolution before becoming this entity of evil
which has tainted all of that around him with the path of darkness.

The Grand Chamber~
You are now in an extremely well decorated room.  On the ceiling are
crystal chandeliers, on the wall are huge draperies and life-size portraits,
on the floor is a red and black striped carpet.  On the east well high above
your reach is a bowl which holds a large flame.  It burns brightly but
safely inside its metal constraints.
