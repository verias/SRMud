mock guard golem~
a guard~
A golem guard stands here ready to detect would be thieves.
~
The guard is little more than a simple golem.  It stands about five feet
tall and is clad in simple breeches and a tunic.  The guard's skin is pure
white and it's face has no eyes.  It is probably blind.  You can detect a
shallow breathing coming from the guard: it may be a thing of magic but it
is obviously at least slightly alive.

you can make out the small hairs covering it.  The antenna twitch slightly
upon your approach.

fighting monsters that will kill you easily.

The second lesson is running away.  You and I will spar but you'll not be able 
to best me.  I am too strong for you to kill, but I won't kill you.  When you 
feel ready type '{CKILL NOSERAB{x'.  After a while, type '{RFLEE{x' to

here.

You can also set your character to flee automatically with the '{YWIMPY{x'

When you are ready to try your hand at real combat in which someone is going

Not everything is as it seems in the Realm Of Discordia. You will find
numerous creatures both fair and foul that fill the land. Those who wish
to survive to see the many wonders the realm provides, will be wary of
many things. Some within the realm are very protective or insidious and
set traps to protect their belongings or just to harm people in general.
 
Certain classes have the ability to detect and disarm such traps through the
use of learned skill or magical prowess. Beware of such things in the realm.

Gardens Along the Mansion~
Standing outside the double glass doors that lead into the mansion, you
can take a good look around at the magnificent grounds.  Along the outside
of the mansion are beautifully kept gardens, but stepping away from the
walls takes one into neatly kept woods.  Beyond these kept woods, the
shadows creep in deeper, as it turns into unkept and wild forest.  Brightly
coloured flowers are at all stages of blossom, and the air here is
fragranced delicately.  Large, slow moving butterflies dip and glide
gracefully from flower to flower as birds chirp merrily from the trees.  A
small cedar chip path leads into the kept woods to the east from here.

Altar~
This room is rather dim, lit only by rows of black candles along the
south wall.  The entire room has been made up as some kind of shrine
dedicated to the various gods of the realm.  A large obsidian altar,
religious symbols etched into its night-black surface, takes up most of the
space.  A simple prayer mat, dark red in colour, sits before the altar.  A

Pretty wild flowers mingle with large blossomed roses here, all in bright

pruned slightly at the bottom, creating a small cave of thorns that shelters
a snowy white cat.  The mother cat blinks her bright green eyes, as she
watches the garden lazily, trying to keep track of her mischievous kittens.

Delicate pale rose bushes line the wall of the mansion and surround a
fountain built against the wood siding of the house.  A spout of fresh water
spurts from the mouth of the Green Man and sparkles as it falls into a basin
in the shape of a sea shell.  The shell has flashes of bright orange moving
about in it, and as one looks into the pool of water, the koi look back. 
Directly south of the small fountain is a well kept cedar chip path that
leads into the groomed woods.

The flowers dwindle off and disappear as the edge of the beautiful
gardens ends at a large iron grate fence.  The cast iron is a dull black and
shaped in intricate designs, ending with sharp points on the tops of the
tall pickets.  Beyond this fence lays wild thick grown woods, and birds can
be seen flying from tree to tree, chasing after squirrels that natter
loudly.  A small red fox sees you and its nose twitches wildly with your
sent as it bares its fangs at you menacingly.  To the south is the neatly
kept woods, and you can see the fence end drastically not too far into them.
Unfortunately, there are large raspberry bushes with sharp thorns blocking
any way of entering the woods here.

east, as the cedar chip path shows care taken in this area.  Tall trees that

which keep the area much cooler than in the gardens and ferns which show no

edge of the mansion through thick raspberry bushes, which prevents your

and the bushes and ferns cover a slightly wet spot in the ground, which bars
your moving that way.  Small birds fly quickly over head, chirping and
singing to each other as they go.  Off in the distance what sounds like
twigs breaking can be heard, as small animals move through the brush.

The cedar path stops suddenly here, turning into a very faint footpath to
the east which leads into darker, wilder woods.  The chips of cedar do
continue westwards through the well kept woods with its groomed trees and
neat ground.  Sounds of rustling brush come from all directions but the
west, and you can see small eyes peering out at you from under heavy leaves.
There is a drastic difference in the trees here to the trees to the east, as
here the bark looks new and healthy, whereas to the east the bark looks
older and gray and has large mushrooms growing on the trunks of the trees.

the north, east and south are all well maintained, looking very planned and
manicured.  Above you are thick large branches that spread out from a tree
to the east.  In the branches you can see a nest with three baby birds
straining their heads out in search of food.

south, the forest thickens and no cedar paths can be made out through the
brush.  To the east the cedar path stops suddenly and turns into a very
faint foot path through ferns and bushes into the deeper parts of the
forest.  Blocking any way south is a massive tree that has small pieces of
wood nailed to the trunk to form a ladder up into the safety of the
branches.

you can't trudge through the slight marshland that forms a ditch running
north-south between this path and the gardens.  A small little green tree
frog hops from branch to branch heading south, croaking you along.

The cedar path is edged neatly with small pieces of stones along the west
side, as this protects the path from the sharp drop into a narrow band of
marshland running north-south.  Through the reeds in the marsh, you can pick
out small green frogs and ducks wading in the murk, and in the distance you
can make out the training mansion.  To the east, the forest becomes much
denser, and your movement in that direction is prohibited by the thorns and
brambles growing thickly around the trees.  The cleanly raked path moves
directly north-south, following its route through the kept woods.

Marshland continues to run north-south to the west of you, though it spreads
slightly into a pond more to the south.  Directly south is a large wrought
iron fence which surrounds the training mansions grounds, to keep unwanted
creatures out, and trainers in.  Looking east, you can see the path continue
extremely straight in that direction until it appears it ends in dark, thick
forest.  The smell of damp earth is overwhelming here as the path is
slightly soggy from the waters of the pond and marsh.

large wrought iron fence with flowers and curls molded in for a more rich
look.  Looking south beyond the fence, the town of Discordia can be seen,
though the hedges between you and the town filter out any sounds that might
reach you here.  North is full of raspberry bushes and thistles a little
further back, as the kept woods becomes more unkempt and wild.  There are a
few bright red squished berries on the path below your feet as you notice a
squirrel with its mouth full dashing off through the thorns into the woods
to the north.

Standing tall and majestic where the path forks to the north and to the
east is a large oak tree.  Nailed into the trunk are a few boards to help a
person climb to some of the lower branches, away from the hazards of the
woods.  The wonderful smelling cedar chip path stops drastically to the
north, and only a faint footpath can be seen leading in that direction
deeper into the woods.  The path however, does continue to the east,
paralleling the wrought iron fence that continues to block access to
Discordia to the south.

The Kept Woods~
Discordia can barely be made out to the south through the thickening
cedar hedges which grow intertwined with the black iron fence.  Edging the
path here are patches of delicate little mushrooms, growing pure white,
which make them appear to almost glow against the brown cedar chips and the
dark green grass.  North of you the forest grows in thickly, with many low
tree branches growing entangled in each other, preventing any movement in
this direction.  The path continues east-west, perfectly straight.

mushrooms~
This patch of mushrooms look absolutely perfect in their shape and
colouring.  There are no spots on them, no rips or damage of any kind.  It
almost seems as though these mushrooms have a magical quality about them to
grow in such a manner.

No variation in the path can be seen here as it runs perfectly east-west.
The chips of wood are perfectly level and give a nice woody smell to the
area.  Birds can be heard chirping amongst the thick brush and trees to the
north, where the sounds of twigs snapping from squirrels moving about can
also be heard.  The cedar hedges to the south thin here, making parts of the
black iron fence plainly visible with Discordia as the backdrop.

The cedar path bends sharply here, continuing to the north and to the
west.  Hedges grow thickly to the south, making the wrought iron fence
barely visible, let alone any view of the town of Discordia possible.  A
faint foot path comes off the main wood chip path to the east here, leading
into wilder and darker forests.  Placed in the sharp part of the bend, but
not on the path, is a strange little pile of rocks.

pile~
This strange pile of rocks doesn't look to be anything an animal could
set up, so therefore it must be human in nature....  Or inhuman and
unearthly.  Smooth rocks from a stream are piled in the shape of a pyramid,
with the top stone being the smoothest and perfectly round.  There is a
leather tie coming from a small hole in this top rock, giving it the perfect
use of a necklace.

The neatly kept cedar chip path stops drastically to the north here.  It
looks as though it was going to continue on in this direction, since the
north edge is left unfinished, whereas the sides are all kept in track with
simple edging techniques.  A small path created by many people's feet goes
off to the south here, as this is the only manageable spot to do so.

The faint path through the ferns and brush of the forest bends here,
running east and south.  Large mushrooms grow around a rotting stump of a
tree, and a long centipede can be seen running for cover in the soft wood as
you approach.  Scratching and twigs breaking can be heard from all around
you, echoing back and forth off trees, giving you no indication of which
direction it really is coming from The brush and trees get extremely thick
and heavy to the north and west, while the path continues in the other
directions.

A slight breeze ruffles the leaves on the trees, sending a small mist of
moisture down onto your head.  The ground here is soft and damp, and a
deeply earthy smell rises up to meet your nostrils.  Looking north and east,
the forest becomes thicker in vegetation, with many thistles growing amongst
the trees and ferns.  The faint foot path you are following leads to the
south and to the west.

The air here is much cooler and damper as the forest closes in slightly
on you.  Feathery ferns brush gently on your legs as you pass down the small
footpath that winds its way through the trees.  The ground visible through
the greenery is a dark brown, almost black and gives off a musty smell.  The
bark on the trees are all covered with lichen, only on the north side
though, aiding you in finding you way in case you lose the path.  The faint
path continues to the north and east while the trees seem to open up more
and with the brightness to the west you can see the cedar path through the
bushes.  The south is blocked by a thick patch of burrs and thistles.

The forest seems to surround and marvel at a massive tree that stands
slightly to the north-east of the crossroads the faint path meeting has
created.  Worn flat wooden boards are nailed to the thick bark.  The boards
look like at one time they had something written on them, and this was used
as a marker to tell you what lies in what direction.  Now, these can be used
to help climb the tree to run away from any wild beast on the ground.  The
faint paths lead off in all directions here, closed in by the cool shadows
from the trees.

It almost appears that you have come into a dead end.  To the north and
east, a large rocky cliff meets you.  The trees grow close to these rocks,
and a few small trees are trying to grow in the rock up the side of the
cliff.  The forest gets extremely dark and closed in to the south, though
there is a faint path leading off in that direction.  The faint path also
leads out to the west, away from the cliff.

The smell of damp earth invades your nose as the trees close in around
you.  Large mushrooms clump together beneath the shade of ferns scattered
around the base of trees.  Branches and fallen trees lean everywhere,
littering the area, giving it a wild look.  Surrounding you to the east and
south are closely placed pine trees with large webs of vines entangled among
the branches, baring any movement in those directions.  A faint path leads
to the north further into the woods, and to the west, the faint path leads
to a nicely kept cedar chip path.

The leaves of ferns reach out to brush your legs as the path dwindles
into nothing except the faintest of trails.  The east shows the trees
parting and opening up to a neatly kept cedar chip path.  The faint path
forming around your feet continues to the east.  Looking to the north, you
can make out the neatly kept trees and grass of the kept woods, though you
are barred from moving there by thickets of raspberry bushes and thistles. 
The south is blocked by a thick mass of pine trees and vines and fallen
debris.

The faint path you are following through these unkept woods leads
west-west in a straight line.  To the east, the woods don't seem to change
much, but to the east, they are much darker and unfriendly looking. 
Raspberries and thistles continue to block your passage to the north, as
does the pines and fallen trees to the south.  Over head, the leaves on the
trees rustle, and the sounds of claws scraping up bark can be heard from the
squirrels climbing up to nuts hanging from branches.  Two small songbirds
fly and play over your head as they dive into the kept woods to the north.

The forest seems to close in around you slightly as burrs reach out to
grab at your legs.  The canopy above your head creates shadows with dapples
of light coming down between the leaves, the shade making these wild woods
cool.  The faint path you follow to navigate easily through these trees and
bushes continues to the south and to the west, where it joins up with a
cedar chip path.  Your movement to the east has been blocked by a fallen
tree leaning carefully against an extremely large tree.  To the north, you
can see the neatly kept woods, but the thicket of burrs and thistles deters
your movement that way.

The faint trail through the woods bends here, leading to the east and to
the north.  A squirrel peeks out through the leaves of a tree, watching you
in your travels through the forest.  Directly to the southwest is a slight
depression in the ground, which has a shallow marsh in it.  In the reeds, a
frog croaks loudly, trying to attract a mate.  This marsh prevents you from
travelling to the west or to the south.

You've reach an intersection in the cool woods, giving you the choice of
continuing through these wilder woods, or heading south to the neat cedar
chip path.  East and west the faint pathway continues, and to the north,
many fallen branches and thick growing vines block your view and ability to
travel in that direction.  Hidden by some heavy leaves, you can make out
some pale purple flowers that look very pretty.

The almost not-there path you are following winds its way past fallen
trees and rotting stumps in an east-west direction.  The damp rotting wood
smell in the air makes the atmosphere in the area like you are hundreds of
miles away from anything.  A fallen tree to the north gives a person enough
clearance beneath it to follow the faint path branching off to the north. 
Looking south, the land is slightly depressed and filled with wet ground and
many thorny plants.  This takes away any chance of moving that way.

The tiny path you have been following through these overgrown woods stops
abruptly at the base of an extremely large tree.  Thick branches protrude in
all directions from the trunk, making it look for an easy climb up into the
safety of the tree.  Surrounding the massive base of this tree are many
stumps and fallen logs, created as this tree grew to the extent it has.  The
branches and debris surround you in all directions, giving you the only
option of going back the way you came.

you can see peeking out of the bushes and greenery.  The path turns here,
leading you south and east.  To the east, this small pathway continues to
wind its way through these overgrown and wild woods.  To the south, you can
make out the neat cedar chip path that will lead to civilization.

You've come across an intersection in a small clearing.  The faint path
you've been following through the forest leads to the north, south and west
from here.  Looking east, you can see why the path doesn't continue that
way, as a slope of almost bare rock reaches skyward.  A few straggly bushes
cling desperately to the rock, trying to get a foothold to be able to grow
larger.  One large tree grows right before the rock juts out of the ground. 
Its branches reach out to you, giving the sense that it will protect you
from any harm below in its safe canopy.

You can just make out the wide cedar chip path to the west through the
brush and fallen trees and branches.  The mess between you and the path is
too great, and no feasible route can be made to directly reach the other
side.  You can move in any other direction however, as the faint path leads
north, south and east from here.  Slightly to the northeast, there is a
skinny, perfectly straight tree that has a massive brownish mushroom growing
on its bark.  The mushroom looks like it would easily just pop off the tree
whole.

A wall of rock greets you here, as you enter a small enclave and are
surrounded by rock to the north and east.  There are no footholds in the
cliff face, as the sedimentary layers crumble with any pressure placed on
them from extreme amounts of weathering wearing the rock down over the
years.  A small trickle of water seeps from the rock to the north, giving
the possibility of caves in the direction.  The path has become dirt here,
as you have escaped the trap of the trees for a brief moment.  The only
openings back into the forest are two small paths leading south and west.

You've stumbled upon an intersection in these woods.  The path you've
been following leads to the north, west and east from here.  Looking west,
this small path opens up in a wide, cedar chip walkway that leads to
friendlier territory and civilization.  The same faint path you're currently
on leads off to the north and to the east, where everything looks the same,
not giving any indication which would be the better way to travel.  The only
choice not available to you is moving to the south, as the way is blocked by
a large wrought iron fence that runs perfectly east-west, enclosing this
forest from the rest of Discordia.

see the safety it offers you from any dangers below.  Two little songbirds
sing merrily amidst the leaves, barely in view from the ground.  A large
wrought iron gate is heavily covered with ivy vines to the south, but in the
few open spaces, you can see the town of Discordia.  Large jagged boulders
have tumbled to the ground to the east of here from the cliffs that are to
the northeast that you can see through the forest.

The forest seems to close in around you, dead branches reaching out like
claws to grab you from the small path that is the only safety.  Tall
evergreen trees surround you, making the rocky ground softer with a thick
cover of needles.  Around the bases of a few trees are some tiny mushrooms
intermingled with burrs.  The path continues to the north where things seem
greener and more friendly, as well as to the south where more of the dark
wild woods continue.  Looking east, a black gaping hole of a cave breaks the
grayness of the rock wall that prevents passage.

furthest depths of the cave to the northeast a grumbling can be heard along
with movement from some creature.

The damp earth smell wafts up from the ground to your nose.  Looking
down, you see the dark, rich soil being wasted by only growing weeds that
snag at your clothing.  Smooth rocks raise up from the earth, giving a firm
place to rest.  You can notice an incline down to the north, where the solid
rock base puddles up water.  Looking in the water, you can see some tadpoles
swimming around and mosquito larva wiggling along the surface.  This water
to the north bars any passage in the direction, though you can follow the
faint path to the west, east and south.

manner.  The sharp twigs from dead trees scratch at your face while burrs
snag and pull at your clothing.  Beaten dirt forms a path for you to follow
through the safest routes here, and lead to the north, east and west.  The
darkness closes in more deeply over the paths, giving you no help in seeing
what each path takes you to.

The ground below you is just bare rock with lichen patches trying to grow
here and there.  A large tree is the only thing that grows here, and around
its base, the rocks are uprooted and shattered as the roots for the tree
grow and push the rock out of their way.  A few branches are low enough to
the ground to make getting up into the safety of the branches easy.  To the
north and east of you, you see large black gaping holes leading into dark
caves.  Looking south, the forest seems much greener and more friendly while
to the west more dark and pressing forest awaits for you.

A Cave in the Deep Wild Woods~
You've come into a dark, cold cave, with many stalactites and stalagmites
dotting the room, giving you a winding path to follow deeper in.  To the
west, the lightness of the outdoors streams through the wide opening of the
cave entrance.  Looking deeper into the cave, the light you carry barely
makes the tunnels leading off to the north, south and east barely
discernable.  Moving into the cavern further lets you see that the tunnels
leading to the north and east have become caved in, and therefore useless to
travel in those directions.  The tunnel leading to the south still gapes
open for you to travel through.  A dark corner in the northeast corner has a
some life in it that doesn't like your presence.

legs and feet here, and only burrs and thistles poke through the clothing
you have on, irritating your skin.  The path you have been following stops
suddenly here, as people before you must have realized how unpassable the
forest surrounding you is.  The only way out is the way you came in to the
east.

The forest here is very dark and closed in.  Tall evergreens reach for
the sky, blocking out light for anything else to live.  All around you are
bare and dead trees, and it seems the only thing that can survive in this
darkness are the thorny bushes and thistles that fill the ground.  A pathway
has been trodden through this area, keeping the ground too hard for any of
these prickly plants to take route to close, giving a semi-safe walkway. 
This path leads off to the west and east, as well as to the south where you
can see much greener and friendlier forests.

A mighty spruce tree grows here, its lower branches bare and thick,
giving you a make-shift ladder up into the safety of the tree.  The ground
is covered with needles, and is soft and buoyant.  The shade from this great
tree makes it impossible for anything to grow here other than mushrooms,
which you can see spreading out everywhere, poking up through the mat of
needles.  Where the canopy of the spruce ends, large thistles and thorn
bushes grow thickly to the south and east, giving you the options of heading
north or west.

The sound of trickling water echoes in this large cavern you have

you've brought into the room.  Looking around, you notice that you've come
to a dead end, and the only way out is the way you took in.  The furthest
corners of the room are pitch black, and impenetrable by your light.  From
one corner, something seems to be alive and moving.

paintings~
The paintings are varied but all show smiling young men and women of
various races in shining armour.  The warriors all have their shields
strapped firmly on their arms and swords out and the sorcerers have all gone
for the "thoughtful" pose.  It all seems strangely silly.

A Safe Room~
You feel the presence of the Gods of Discordia shining down upon you from
within this small, barren room. Obviously blessed by the powers that be, you
feel that this would be a safe place to take a break from your training.
When you are finished licking your wounds, you can return to the entrance
through a shimmering portal mounted against the northern wall. A large

may lead to places unknown and of great danger."

sign~
Not everything is as it seems in the Realm Of Discordia. You will find
numerous creatures both fair and foul that fill the land. Those who wish
to survive to see the many wonders the realm provides, will be wary of
many things. Some within the realm are very protective or insidious and
set traps to protect their belongings or just to harm people in general.
 
Certain classes have the ability to detect and disarm such traps through the
use of learned skill or magical prowess. Beware of such things in the realm.

Your Debut~
{xHaving completed your early training to your master's satisfaction, you 
have been sent here to a seemingly unremarkable room.  On the walls are 
large portraits of imposing figures.  Beneath each is a plaque with names,
which you recognize as the heroes of Discordia.

Perhaps one day, a portrait of yourself will adorn these walls.  There are 
many lessons that you have yet to learn before your adventure begins.  
This would be a good time to assess your status.  {CLOOK{x at yourself to see 
what you are wearing.
 
Near the center of the room is a small, white table, which holds a tattered 
tablet.  Maybe you should {CLOOK TABLET{x.
 
A large rectangular portal shimmers near the north side of the room.  On 
the ground, next to the portal a small figure sits cross-legged.  She is your 
teacher for the rest of your training and will show you much to help you 
become a successful adventurer ({CLOOK FIGURE{x).

A Cluttered Parlor~
{xTizi follows you through the portal as you enter a cluttered parlor.  A
long red, crushed-velvet sofa stands in the center of the room.  Soft
lights, covered with paper globes, give just enough warm light for you
to see the details of the impressive collection of items in the room.

An exit leads to the east, and you can hear mumbling coming from that
direction.  A young girl sits here, playing with a doll with a broken
arm.  She seems to be more than happy to help young adventurers such
as yourself to find their way into the realm ({CLOOK GIRL{x).

clutter~
Small statuettes and various sizes of snow-globes take up every bit of
space on the tables and shelves which have been carefully placed in this
room for maximum shelf space.  The predominate color in the room is red,
long pieces of red velvet cover the table surfaces.

girl~
{xShe smiles sweetly and says:

The directions you can go in any room are: {Ynorth{x, {Rsouth{x, {Ceast{x, 
{Gwest{x, {Mup{x, or {Wdown{x. Of course, not all rooms have all exits 
available. Keep in mind that you really should read all room descriptions 
carefully or you may find yourself walking off a cliff and falling to your 
death.

To see the obvious exits in a room, type '{REXITS{x'.
Sometimes doors are closed, or locked, or secret.  Then you have to notice
clues in the room description, or try going in that direction and seeing
if you bump into a door.

Another excellent feature we have installed for your adventuring needs is
the {YAUTO{y {xcommand. To see a list of our auto features simply type:

Mystic's Parlor~
{xThe lighting in this room is very dim causing you to have to squint to
see the figure sitting at the head of large table, which constitutes the only
furnishing in the room.  A set of ajar wooden doors leads to the south and
double windowed doors lead east into what appears to be a garden or park of
some kind.  There is an exit to the north.  
 
In front of the wizened old mystic is a set of octagonal cards, each with a 
different, sometimes disturbing picture on it.  She looks up and looks you over
from head to toe.
 
{GTizi tells you{x 'When you are done here, go north if you are less than level
five or the east to gain further experience.

Each card is the size of Oba's hand, fully extended.  They are octagon
shaped and boardered in gold.  They are layed out in a deliberate pattern,
some touching others.  The picture on the faces of each card is fairly
detailed.  Some show humanoids, many have pictures of various weapons.  In
the center is one which depicts a corpse, with blood which oozed from many
wounds.

{xThis room was once a grand ballroom.  Scuffed wooden floors only hint of the 
memory of couples gliding over them in delicate embraces.  Dust-covered 
chandeliers hang from above.  For now, the room affords lots of room for the 
practicing of skills and spells.  Exits lead north and south.  Along the
eastern wall, windows look out over a park-like setting.
