Najee the healer~
Najee sits on the edge of the fountain, running her fingers in the water.
~
A beautiful woman, Najee looks at you serenely, as though she is in
another plane of existence, where everything is perfect.  Clothed simply in
a white robe, her pale reddish skin looks a little darker than it normally
should.  Bright brown eyes look at you through thick black lashes as her
long hair tumbles freely around her face and shoulders.

Three heads all watch you keenly, eyeing you like a meal as each head
drools and bares its fangs at you.  Matted brown and black fur bristles up

ground, leaving huge marks.

Dark red skin matches the colour of the metal that is preparing in the
flames of the large fire near him.  He wears only a pair of loose cloth
pants that are rather worn looking and a heavy leather apron.  Sweat
glistens over his body and bald head, making him sparkle magically as he
works.  He grunts a greeting to you, and watches you as you look over his
wares.

a sheen of sweat from working.  His orange skin is like the fire which is

the fact that his clothing is splattered with dark and bright red blood
stains.  Most of his head is shaved, save for a small top knot of braided
black hair that occasionally swings into his face.  He looks over to you and

Afya's yellow skin is set off by the dark colours of blues, reds, purples
and greens she wears.  A long kerchief skirt jingles with bells and hangs
off her hips, accentuating her tiny waist.  A small black velvet top is
sequined with small gold bells as well.  Her long black hair hangs around
her petite face in many braids which have gold threads woven into them. 
Thick lashes hide her eyes from view, though you can see the sparkle
underneath them.

Back Alley~
The dirt path leads through crumbling buildings, running north and south.
A strange haze fills the pathway in either direction, not giving you much
insight into what lays in either direction.  Rats squeal at you loudly as
you move past them, angry at your intrusion into their territory.  A glow of
light comes out of an open doorway to the east here, breaking part of the
haze, almost beckoning you in.

Back Alley~
A strange haze fills the air here, not letting you see far down the path
to either the north or the west.  Even more strange, is that the haze gets
thicker to the west, and glows with a strange white light.  You can hear
nothing in this area, and the path seems void of any other life but
yourself.

Back Alley~
Surrounded by a deadening haze, you can barely see two inches in front of
your nose.  A strange pulsating white light illuminates the haze brightly to
the south here, while everywhere else stays a dismal dark grey.  No sound
can be heard, regardless of how much you strain your ears, giving you an
unsettled and on-edge feeling.  A door painting an ungodly shade of red
blocks your way to the light to the south here.

east, which is the only way out of this corner.

The Cages Tavern~
Dimly lit, and for good reason, this tavern is barely above a cesspit.  A
strange smell fills the room, which could either be the dirty and sweaty
patrons of this bar, strange food being cooked, food rotting, or a mixture
of all of the above.  Glints of metal can be seen in the candle light at
each table, and you feel a steady gaze of all the patrons on you as the room
quiets with your entry.  The room has no windows and the walls are covered
in grime and old blood stains.  There seems to be only two types of alcohol
lined up in many bottles behind the bar.  They alternate between a dark
liquid and a glowing red liquid.

Birthing Pools Slave Shop~
An eerie silence surrounds you as you stand in the middle of a strange
room.  Along the northern wall, a row of rusted steel cages act as a
punishment for any pet or slave that isn't behaving as it should.  You can
hear a pathetic whimpering coming from one of the cages, and looking closer,
you can see a petite Efreet girl curled up inside it, looking at you with
sad eyes.  Tied up by their necks along the southern wall are male and
female Efreeti, hands kept behind their backs, but eyes begging at you to
take them.  Sitting next to a grungy desk, looking more like a statue than a
living creature, is a vicious looking cerberus.

This front hall of the building is strangely lit with a white glowing orb
floating just below the ceiling that pulsates its light out like a strobe
into the darkness.  The walls to the east and west of you are close
together, making a narrow passage leading either south, deeper into the
building, or north to a door leading to the road.  These walls are painted
an unappealing shade of red, as is the floor and ceiling.  You can hear a
strange chanting coming from within the bowels of the building.

shade of red - even the floor and ceiling.  The western wall is completely
covered with scribblings and mad writing in many different languages, none
of which you can make out.  Some of the scribblings even look to be written
in blood, or else the wall is bleeding from the scratching in of the words. 
A small kneeling stool is set up facing this strange wall.

Order of Fire~
This room is more of a long hall, stretching to the east and the west,
with a small, narrow hallway reaching to the north.  All along the base of
the southern wall is a flame which emits no heat and burns nothing, but
seems to continue to grow larger with each passing moment.  Behind the fire
you can see a ghastly red wall that seems to move and breathe on its own. 
If you look closer, you occasionally see a face form in the wall, screaming
out for help before being forced back into it.  All around you a strange
chanting can be heard.

You are surrounded by impermeable darkness.  Your light does not make a
dent in the blackness.  What sounds like a heart beating fills your head as
you can not tell what direction it comes from.  If you reach out to touch
the walls, your hand seems get get grabbed on to and pulled into the wall by
an unseen force.  Two little red orbs glow side by side, floating around the
entire room, acting like eyes watching you, sizing you up, planning the
attack...

On a Dock Before Fire Lake~
This wooden dock creaks and groans under any small amount of weight, you
wonder it doesn't collapse.  Making you wonder even more, how does the dock
not burn up from the lake of fire it stands in?  The heat of the tonnes of
burning magma this lake is made from presses in around you, making you feel
heavy and tired.  Far off in the distance to the north, west and south you
can see the faint edges of the crater this lake of fire fills.  To the east,
you can see a tall building rising above a city.

Fire Lake~
You are completely surrounded by unmoving burning magma.  Occasionally a
large bubble of fire escapes from the magma, casting itself high into the
air.  Heat from the flames press in around you, making you feel heavy and
drowsy, but the flame does not burn, and is almost cool to the touch.  All
around you is more of the lake, though you can see the edges of the crater
off in the distance all around you, except to the east, where you can see a
city rising from the flames.

Fire Lake~
You are completely surrounded by unmoving burning magma.  Occasionally a
large bubble of fire escapes from the magma, casting itself high into the
air.  Heat from the flames press in around you, making you feel heavy and
drowsy, but the flame does not burn, and is almost cool to the touch.  All
around you is more of the lake, though you can see the edges of the crater
off in the distance all around you, except to the east, where you can see a
city rising from the flames.

Daza Crescent~
A narrow road of smoothed blackened rock leads you through a residential
area of Mar Narev.  The sounds of the city fade away into the distance as
houses around you block out the noises from the City Hall and Market areas
of town.  Simple but neat houses surround you on the north and south sides
of the road as the street leads you in an east-west direction.  Peeking in
the windows of the houses, you can see women cooking in the kitchens while
children fly around and play.  Sometimes you can even see an Efreet man
sitting at a table, smoking a pipe while deep in thought.  A door leads into
one of these houses to the north, while only windows line the back of a
house to the south.

A Simple House~
This small house by no means looks as though the poor live here.  Though
it is a single room, everything is kept in its place and kept extremely
clean.  You can see a small child's toy laying in the corner next to a bed
that seems extremely large for the size of the room.  Opposite the room from
the bed is a large fire place that has a huge cooking pot boiling some
delicious-smelling food.  A large table separates the two main features of
the room, only this table has short legs, so no chairs are needed to use it.
The walls are a clean white, void of all decorations, though there are two
small windows beside the door to the south, and another three small windows
in the northern wall.

A Simple House~
A large room seems to be the entirety of the house, but everything inside
it seems to fit and have its place.  Set in the north-east corner of the
room is a large fire place, where a fire blazes beneath a large cooking pot.
Butting up against the eastern wall next to the fire place is a narrow table
with two chairs facing the wall.  Opposite the fire on the western wall is a
crisply-made bed, which has pillows set up along it to make it act like a
couch as well.  A single window brings in light from the northern wall,
competing with the small windows framing the door to the south.

The Parlor of a Grand Mansion~
The first thing you notice in this room is the large crystal chandelier
that hangs like diamonds of water falling from the heavens.  Light emitted
from inside the crystals somewhere casts star-like impressions on the floors
and walls of the room, highlighting little features which exemplify the
richness of the owner of the house.  All the furniture is a deep-coloured
wood, overstuffed, and upholstered with patterned silks in bright colours. 
The floor is lined with many rugs, each in different shades and patterns,
but the over all effect looks like planned disorganization.

A Grand Mansion~
You find yourself in the cool whiteness of a large mansion.  Sparkling
white stone is polished to a high shine on the floor, while it is left
unpolished for the walls.  Tall wide windows line the eastern wall, and
frame the door to the west.  The windows are curtained by an almost totally
sheer gauze-like material, also in white, which seem to move in an unfelt
breeze.  Between the windows are large paintings or beautiful tapestries
depicting times of glory and power of the Efreet people.  Large reddish wood
double doors fill most of the northern and southern walls, of which the
northern doors are left wide open.  Set next to these doors on either side
of them are tall, bushy green tropical plants.

The Study of a Grand Mansion~
You find yourself in a room which seems to have a constant hush about it.
Rich wooden desks, chairs, sofas and bookcases fill the room with a
reddish-golden hue, almost like a glow.  This study looks well lived-in, as
books lay open on almost all surfaces, and papers with writings are
scattered about, some pieces fallen to the ground.  A single large window
fills the southern wall, curtained with a heavy indigo velvet, which accents
the greens and reds of the rugs laid out on the polished white stone floor. 
Dark paintings are framed in heavy gold gild depicting battle scenes of
great creatures.

A Simple House~
This simple house seems to be in a state of disorder, and not from
children, as there is no indication of child's toys anywhere in the mess. 
Dirty dishes fill the small table tucked in the north-west corner of the
room beneath a tiny window in the southern wall next to the door.  A small
mattress is a mess of sheets and clothing in the south-eastern corner of the
room, and a trail of clothing leads one from the door to this area.  The
large stones that form the fire place on the other side of the door are
covered with soot and blackened.  There is no roaring fire or cooking food
there, just an empty coldness.

A Simple House~
This tiny cottage of a house is in a state of disrepair.  A broken and
dusty wooden table sprawls in the centre of the room, while cobwebs fill the
corners of the ceiling, so thickly it's almost like there are no sharp
corners.  Pieces of stone lay on the floor around the fire place, and
crumpled pieces of paper are tossed inside the hearth and are covered with
black soot.  The single window in the southern wall is cracked, and a piece
of the glass is missing.  No one could possibly live here with the house in
the state it's in.

the north and west walls, and frame the door in the south wall.  A large
flagstone fire place is centred in the eastern wall, and almost fills it
completely.  There is a cheerful fire crackling away, and two bowls of soup
on the hearth to warm.  Nestled in the north-west corner is a bed which is
raised high off the ground.

A Simple House~
You seem to be in the front room of a house, which acts as a living area,
kitchen, and play area for the children.  A door is set in the southern
wall, but when you try it, it seems to be stuck.  You can only assume that
behind this door is the bedroom.  A row of small windows lines the eastern
wall, beneath which is the clutter of children's toys and books.  Just west
of the door in the northern wall, is a massive stone fire place, which has
the beginnings of a blazing fire in it.  Next to this, near the western wall
is a long table with many chairs around it, and it's currently covered with
an array of vegetables that look to be the preparations of an upcoming meal.

Beach Outcrop~
This narrow strip of beach runs in a seemingly endless stretch north and
south of here, though it is broken by small streams of lava, making it
impossible to move in either direction.  White sand pools out beneath you,
and you can feel intense heat radiating up from the ground.  Looking to the
east from this vantage point, you can see a city far off in the distance
rising out of a lake of fire.  A worn sandy path leads you to the west
through burnt and dried vegetation, away from the intense heat of the lake
next to you.

Path Through Burnt Vegetation~
A white sandy path twists and winds it way east and west through dried
and burnt vegetation.  Large blackened stumps of trees jut up from brown
long grass like gangrenous limbs from an almost dead land.  The wind
whistles through the vegetation, sounding more like a lost soul howling in
its pain.  You can see the glow of a large fire to the east and looking west
you can see life coming to the land.

Beautiful white sand sparkles in the light, almost like you are passing
over diamonds.  You are surrounded to the north and south by rough and dried
vegetation, occasionally spotting a blackened stump of a tree through the
brown brambles and thorns.  Immediately next to the path and a little in to
the dead flora, you are cheered by the sight of small sprigs of new bright
green grass and small flowers.  The sand path leads to an orange glow off to
the east, and into more of the dried vegetation to the west.

Before Kurat's Hideout~
The forest unwillingly opens to form a miniature clearing, which is, in
fact, nearly too small to be considered a clearing.  The trees curve
overhead to more or less block the sunlight at day, and even the ground is
not entirely free of bushes.  Nearly invisible amidst the wild foliage is
what seems to be a metal door, strategically situated at the center of the
clearing by a large rock and a bush.  The door leans strongly towards the
ground and probably leads to some underground area.

Sparkling white sand forms a path beneath you that bends around a large
dune that is to the south-east of you.  You can hear a swishing sound that
comes from the steady breeze moving through the long dried grasses around
you.  In the distance to the east you can see waves of heat blocking your
view of anything else out there.  The path continues to the south, gradually
turning from sand to dirt.  Peeking though the brown grasses along the edge
of the path, you can see small green sprouts of new grasses.

A few stairs lead you underground and into Kurat's very hideout.  The
first chamber seems very much bare, containing a few means with which the
guards observe the outside, as well as some miserable chairs in case the
guards are in need of rest.  A pile of thin blankets serve as a sleeping
area, while westwards, a reinforced wooden door can be seen.  Quite
strangely, the slot in which a key-hole would normally be is dominated by a
ring-shaped marking.

The Living Room~
The living room of Kurat's hideout is reserved to his most trusted
underlings.  The room itself is quite richly decorated and even cozily
designed, a fireplace dominating the southern wall and a dark red carpet
stretching from wall to wall.  No less than a brown leather couch rests by
the fireplace, and even pictures adorn the walls.  Undoubtedly out of place
is a large oaken closet stuck at the southwestern corner, its shelves
bustling with books.

Finally, you have arrived to the secret abode of Kurat Bloodmist, leader
of the red operations within the structure of his mercenary guild.  The
chamber is perfectly round and displays no less than royal decorations which
succesfully maintain good taste and design.  A large wooden desk dominates
the very center of the chamber, surrounded by several armchairs of the
finest leather.  A thin red veil conceals a large bed to the west, while
otherwise the only exit is back east.

The grasses covering this field look to be slightly dried out and sparse.
You can spot the burned and blackened stumps of what once used to be immense
trees standing above the grasses.  A worn dirt path below you leads you
around the large dune that is to the east, winding through the grasses in a
general north-south route.  Looking along the path more to the north, you
can see the dirt gradually start to change into a white sand.

Long grasses sway in a gentle breeze that seems to be a constant feature

forest rising from the grasses of the field.  Off in the distance to the
east, you can see waves of heat blurring the landscape and any idea at what
could be beyond the large dune that also blocks your vision.  The dirt path
you are over now also leads to the north around the large dune.

The Edge of an Eerie Forest~
Ancient trees are sparse in number as you are on the edge of an eerie
forest.  A small footpath winds its way between the massive trunks of the
trees in a generally east-west direction.  Looking east, you can see an open
field with small rolling hills and long grasses.  To the west lies only a
silent darkness.  Around you you can hear what sounds like a person howling
and moaning as though they have lost something terribly important to them. 
It seems to be originating from the forest.

An Eerie Forest~
Coolness descends upon you like a sheet of ice, and you suddenly feel
shivers running up your spine.  Massive trees reach to the heavens, their
branches far above your head, and their trunks making the east-west footpath
you can see, wind.  Not a sound can be heard of any life here, so a strange
creaking and moaning sound that seems to be coming from all around you is
amplified.  A strange darkness fills the spaces between the trees to the
north and south, giving you the feeling that staying on the small path
beneath you is the best plan.

The Edge of a Large Field~
The long grasses of the field gradually decrease as a sudden line of
trees grows and blocks most of the sunlight on the ground.  A cool breeze
seems to be coming out from between the trees to the east, and looking
further in that direction, you can't see very far into the forest.  The
cheery sounds of birds and crickets that come from the large field to the
west are quieting down, and the eerie silence of the forest seems to prevail
here.

A Large Field~
Long grasses brush past your legs as you move along the path that has
been created by them being bent to the sides.  The chatter of crickets and
birds fills the air around you, making this experience more like spending a
day in a park than moving to a destination.  You can see a magnificent
castle in the distance to the south west, and the grasses part in a path to
the west to lead you to this place.  However, the grasses also part in a
path to the east, leading towards a dark forest.  The entrance to a small
town is visible to the north, accessible from the path leading in the same
direction.

Stairs Around the City Hall~
Wide steps make an inclined path between the road and the City Hall of
Mar Narev.  You stand about mid-way up the steps, and looking the rest of
the way up, you can see the impressive stone City Hall building.  Huge
blocks of a reddish stone make up these steps, and they are for the most
part in good condition.  There is an odd deep crack running jaggedly from
the bottom up a few flights that steam and a yellowish glow seem to escape
from.  Looking back down the steps, you can see the blackened stone road
that leads you around the city.

crack~
Looking closer at the crack through the stone steps, you can see down to
a flowing river of magma that runs beneath the city.

Mar Narev City Hall~
Cool white stones stand around you solidly, forming thick walls that seem
to keep the warm air outside this building.  The floor is polished to a high
shine, so the black surface reflects your image back to you almost
perfectly.  All around you something seems to be going on, whether it's
small legal disputes or just groups of people socializing with each other. 
Tall windows stand from floor to ceiling, and are uncurtained, giving you a
good vantage point over the entire city.  These windows are separated by
small alcoves that contain statues and busts of important Mar Narev citizens
throughout history.

The Mayor's Office~
A spacious room, this office is decorated for someone of great importance
in the city.  Glancing about the room, you see only one large window set in
the western wall, which is almost the entire wall in itself.  Sprawled
across the polished floor is a thick detailed rug in deep rich colours that
matches with the large tapestries that hang from the northern and southern
walls.  Placed prominently in front of the window is a large, intricately
carved desk, behind which a leather chair sits.  This room just oozes
wealth.

shiny brass plaque on it reads "Mayor".

Faris Road~
Hard blackened stones seem to have been pounded down to form this almost
perfectly smooth road.  Small holes have formed along the edges of the road,
and you can tell where some of these holes have been patched over.  Looking
out from the city, you can see a large lake of fire that surrounds it, and
further off in the distance you can make out the edge of the crater that
this city is centred in.  The road bends here, in an east-south direction,

and you can tell where some of these holes have been patched over.  Looking
to the west, all you can see for miles is a large lake of fire that seems
endless, which surrounds the city of Mar Narev.  The road runs perfectly
north-south here, and directly to your east is a set of large reddish stone
stairs that lead up to an important looking building.

looks to act more like a dock protrudes out to the west here.

Mahtar Street~
You stand on a sturdy stone bridge.  Beneath you is a fast flowing stream
of lava, bursting the occasional flame high into the sky around you.  The
bridge is perfectly aligned with a north-south axis, where north leads you
towards the city hall, and south takes you to the markets.

Mahtar Street~
The narrow street you find yourself on has been roughened by carts and
many feet travelling over its surface for many years.  Two troughs run down
the narrow lane from cart wheels, and now they are used for Efreeti children
to chase each other along.  The din of people haggling over goods surrounds
you as you enter into the market place of Mar Narev.  Crowds of Efreet of
all ages push in around you, trying to get their errands run as quickly as
possible before going about other business.  The rutted road leads you
deeper into the market place to the south, and away from the crowds to the
north.  A sign above the open door to the west depicts some vegetables and
fruits in bright colours.

Mahtar Street~
Two troughs run down the narrow lane from cart wheels, and now they are
used for Efreeti children to chase each other along.  A dull roar of Efreeti
conversations surround you as you find yourself deep within the market place
of Mar Narev.  Crowds of Efreet of all ages push in around you, trying to
get their errands run as quickly as possible before going about other
business.  The rutted road bends around a corner leading you deeper into the
market place to the east, and to the fringes of the market to the north.  An
open door to the west lets you see mannequins modelling beautiful outfits
inside the store, while the sign above the door indicates that this is
'Faridah's Fineries'.

Mahtar Street~
You find yourself in the depths of Mar Narev's market place, surrounded
by a dull roar of Efreeti conversations.  Crowds of Efreet of all ages push
in around you, trying to get their errands run as quickly as possible before
going about other business.  Children wind their way through the crowds,
chasing each other down the cart troughs left in the narrow road.  The
rutted lane leads you to more stores both to the east and the west.  An open
doorway to the north gives you a glance inside at vast amounts of armor
laying about, while a fence blocks off what looks like was another road to
the south here.

can't see what's inside because curtains are pulled shut across the windows.

Fresh Produce~
This large bright room is filled with all sorts of fruits and vegetables,
all of which look perfectly ripe and juicy.  Rough wooden bins are set up
around the room with no sense of order.  These are filled to over flowing
with the various produce that are for sale here.  Above each bin, you can
see a small mist hovering, which occasionally drifts down to cover the
fruits and vegetables to clean them and give them a high sheen making them
more desirable.  The lighting in the room comes from the ceiling, which is
filled with sky lights, and in between these are white glowing orbs.

Faridah's Fineries~
Statuesque mannequins stand clothed in richness about the shop, posed to
look as though they are customers.  The walls are lined with rolls of
colourful material in all types.  Satins glow with a soft sheen while
velvets drape heavily in soft folds.  Most of the store is filled with male
and female clothing, while a small back corner is filled with accessories
ranging from shoes to gloves to jewelry.  The constant hum of a sewing
machine drones in the background, while a small wind chime, which hangs in
the open door to the east, sends beautiful chimes throughout the store.

Hotri's Armors~
Armor of all types set out on tables surrounds you in the coolness of
this store.  The smell of leather in the air is tinged with a slight
metallic scent as well.  Along the walls of the shop, a few Efreet workers
are sewing thick pieces of leather together or linking rings together into a
tight weave.  The armor on display ranges from simple thick leather pieces
to chain mail to heavy solid steel.  The shop looks well stocked with many
items, and you feel sure you can find exactly what you need here.

The Weaponry~
The loud clang of metal on metal deafens you as it echoes around the hazy
room.  A large fire burns hotly in the north eastern corner of the room, and
you can see long bands of metal sticking out of it as they wait to turn
red-hot.  Though there is the massive fire in the room, it is still somehow
kept cool in the rest of the shop.  Through the smoke haze, you can see all
sorts of gleaming weapons hanging from the walls, and standing tall in
barrels.  Everything seems to be in an organized mess, as you look around
and shop for the perfectly forged weapon you desire.

Saaim's Butchery~
The butchery is fairly bare of furnishings, making the room look much
larger than it probably is.  A cooling breeze seems to be flowing in a
circle around the room, but you cannot detect any source for this.  Set up
along the back wall to the east is a long heavy wooden table that has been
stained a dark reddish-brown over the years.  Hanging from meat hooks behind
the table are various slaughtered animals which are missing chunks of their
body.  Another table fills the southern wall, but this looks like a large
grill, and the wonderful smell of cooking meats fills your nostrils.

The Potion Shop~
This small and cramped store is kept dimly lit with red glowing orbs that
float above some small tables filled with potions.  A strange smell of
exotic incense fills your head and gives you a strange feeling as your head
spins slightly, giving you a hard time to focus on any one thing in front of
you.  Sectioning off the back southern part of the room is a glowing gate
that blocks your path from getting close to the masses of glasswares that
are bubbling strange brews in an array of bright colours.  The air in the
room is crackling with a magical energy, guiding you to your purchase as
though it knows exactly what it is you came here for.  A door partly covered
by curtains leads out to the market place to the north.

Back Alley~
What appears to be almost a dirt foot path begins (or ends) suddenly at a
rickety wooden fence.  The area around you looks to be the oldest part of
the town, and is quite run down.  It's no wonder why the citizens of Mar
Narev chose to close this section behind a fence.  Everything is in shades
of greys and blacks, even the dirt beneath you and the sky above you.  Rats
scurry from holes in the bases of the buildings on either side of you, and
strange howling sounds can be heard coming from all around you.  A loud
raucous can be heard erupting from a dimly-lit building to the west, where a
crude painting of a cage can barely be made out next to the open door.
