scars can be seen, standing out pale against his sun-tanned skin, a living
testament to the fights he has seen and won.  A light tan hide covers his
lower equine half looking unremarkable except for its shine.  The hooves of
his feet have been buffed and polished so they all but glimmer.

hours of work she must put in.  As she notices your approach a smile plays
over her lips in greeting.

Long before the War of the Ancients, it was believed a people existed
that were both horse and man, not a mix of the two races as we seem to be. 
These people, if the Myth of Dyanosus can be believed, had the ability to
change between the two forms at will.  This they sacrificed, so as to become
the greatest knights within the realm, able to combat the growing evils that
infested these lands at that time.  Their four-fold deity granted them this
and thus were the centaurs born, man and horse as one, able to withstand the
evil magics that could be thrown at them, yet able to wield fair power in
return.

Upon A Plain~
Long grasses move like waves in the slightest breeze and flatten low in
stronger winds.  Here and there, small bushes grow, more than likely from
seed spread from the forest that stands to the east.  To both the north and
south, the plains seem to stretch away without change, while to the west,
the plain is dotted with brightly colored tents.

flutter given the slightest chance.  West the plain is dotted with brightly
colored tents, while to the east the plain looks empty in comparison.  Over

At A Lake Edge~
Clear waters lap softly against the lake's bank, caressing the lush green
reeds, that grow there.  A soft croaking sound comes from the reeds, filling
the air with its own melody.  To the north and east the lake spreads away,
like some great mirror fashioned by a forgotten god.  To the south and west
there are dark, ancient wood lands stand like giants of another age, their
limbs stretching up to the heavens.

Long blade-like reeds grow away from the bank of the lake that stretches
away to the south from here.  From deep within the reed bed, a soft buzzing
sound can be heard, most likely the product of some insect.  Lilies as white
as fresh snow float gracefully between there own dark green pads.  East and
west the lake bank continues on, curving slightly around, while to the north
an ancient looking forest stands tall and proud.

On A Lake~
White lily flowers bob upon the surface of the waters, their large, flat
green pads home to the occasional croaking frog.  Looking out over the
still, peaceful, clear waters in any direction the banks of this body of
fluid can be seen.  Standing past the lake is an ancient and mighty looking
forest, the trees tall and gnarled-looking with age, clearly visible from
this distance.  The soft scent of lilies taints the air, wafting gently.

small trail leads into the dense forest that stands tall and ancient in its
magnificence.  From this the lilting song of some unseen bird drifts to your
ears.  If you would happen to glance at the lake, you notice the waters are
so clear you can see the bottom.

The Tilting Grounds~
A wooden divide runs from west to east here forming a very long run. 
Either side of the divides the ground has been run to bare earth, compacted
like rock, by countless hooves.  Some distance from the tilt ropes have been
placed on wooden stakes to create a safe place for spectators to watch from.
To the south east a large stone building stands, while to the north east a
tent far larger than the others has been pitched.  All around here, other
tents have been pitched.

North Of The Temple~
To the south a large arched doorway has been set into an ornately carved
stone building, something about the construction seems to infer that it is
sacred to someone.  The carvings seem to depict horses, humans and centaurs
all living happily.  To the north a path of polished stones has been laid
running towards a very large tent, it stops some distance from it though it
obviously leads there.  East and west of you grass covered plains stretch
out hemmed in by woodlands.

A Large Wheel-Shaped Stone~
A large stone shaped like a wheel sits here, dark stains upon its
surface.  The grass around this stone does not seem to have been touched or
walked upon in some time.  The tents pitched closest to this area seem to
have tried to keep some distance from it still.  The tent to the south seems
to almost be hiding in the lee of the stone building that stands there.  Far
to the north, east and west a forest can be seen over the tops of more
brightly colored tents.

E
stone~
This stone must have been carried some distance as it does not appear
like any you have seen close to here.  It has been carved with skill so that
it looks to be perfectly round and its top and bottom flat.  Cut deeply into
the stone, from the center, a groove about one inch in depth runs to the
outer edge.  The grey of the stone has become stained a dark redish brown in
places, and the goove seems to have even more of this stain in it.  You get
the impression that this may have been either used for blood sacrifice or
executions.

E
stains~
These stains upon the wheel shaped stone look a lot like dried blood,
going by the redish brown color.

At a Green Woodland Tent~
A tent the same colors as the forest has been pitched here with great
skill.  The ground has become slightly worn as if by the passage of many
hoofed feet, going by the marks left behind.  To the northeast a building
made of wood stands while to the southwest another building, this time made
of stone, is present.  To all other directions more tents can be seen, over
the tops of these a dense forest is clearly visible.

Outside Kire's Clothing~
To the north a large wooden building stands upon the grassy plain.  A
sign over the door proclaims the building to be Kire's Clothing.  To the
east an open plain can be seen while to the west and south brightly colored
tents have been pitched.  The grass is trampled here and the earth is
spotted by hoof prints.  High over head a small dot must be some kind of
bird.

Upon A Plain~
Wild flowers grow happily mixed in with the tall grasses all around. 
Here and there some of the grass has been flattened by some large creature. 
To the east a dense looking forest stands, the tree stretching there arms up
towards the heavens.  To the south, north and west the plain continues, west
wards many tents have been set up for forming a village or town.

Upon A Plain~
The long grasses move like waves in the slightest breeze.  Every now and
then, a squeaking sound can be heard coming from all around, most likely
caused by numerous mice.  Westward, a multitude of brightly colored tents
have been pitched, forming a village or small town by the look of it.  To
both the north and south, open plains stretch away, while to the east a dark
forest looms tall and ancient.

At An Indigo Tent~
A round indigo color tent has been placed here with great care, quite
close to a large wooden building that stand to the south.  Wild flowers grow
close to the tent, presumably why the tent has been place just where it has.
To the east an open plain stretches out and over this a old looking woodland
can be seen.  To both the north and west the plain seems dotted with many
gay colored tents.

All around tents have been pitched, the grass here has become worn as if
by the passage of many hoofed feet.  Some small way off to the southeast, a
shed-like, wooden building stands.  To the southwest, a large stone building
has been built long ago.  Far to the east an ancient forest grows proud over
the grassy plain.

In The Shelter Of A Temple~
Placed in the cover of a large temple like building, a lemon tent
resides.  Passage to both the west and south is blocked by the strong
looking stone walls of the building.  East and northwards, more tents have
been placed and over the tops of these a few wooden building and a large
looking forest can be seen.  A small pennant on the top of the lemon tent
hangs limply out of the wind.  The stone building has been carved with much
care and great skill, the carving show centaurs humans and horse living in
harmony.

Great arches have been carved into the stone walls of this hall.  To the
north an open archway leads to a tent dotted plain, while to the south a
large chamber stands open.  Skillful carvings line the walls to the east and
west, each seems to have been done with great care and love.  Strangely the
outside of the temple seems larger that it looks to be from the inside.  The
whole of this place seems strangely calm and relaxing, almost as if
something is watching over it.

A Sky-blue Tent Close to a Temple~
Both south and east, high stone walls seem to make part of a temple,
blocking movement in those directions.  Carved into the walls are images
that look like centaurs, horses and humans living in bliss.  Set at the base
of the wall, a sky blue tent has been placed seemingly so that it is out of
the wind.  To the north and west numerous other tents stand upon the grass
lands.

A Fire Pit~
A large area of grass has been cleared in the plain, well away from the
tents, the ground is blackened by fire.  Off to one side, the equipment
needed to set up some spits has been left, stacked in a tidy manner.  To the
southeast a large temple like building made of stone stands upon the plain,
while to the southwest a wooden shed like structure has been constructed. 
All around, brightly colored tents have been placed, dotting the landscape. 
At a distance off to the west a forest, the trees old and gnarled grows as
it seems to have always done.

Outside a Royal Purple Tent~
Pitched close to a large wooden building, a royal purple tent stands upon
the grassy plain.  From a small hole or vent in the top of it, smoke can be
seen curling up to the sky above.  The wooden shed like building has no
entrance visible on its clearly-visible northern wall.  Off to the west over
more grassland, a forest seeming as old as time stands tall and proud, great
trees stretch there limbs up sky wards.  More tents can be seen pitched to
the east, north and south.

A small stream curls its way from the ancient woodland that stands tall
and proud to the west heading southwards.  Long grasses move like waves in
the gentlest of any breeze and the sounds of small animals can be heard
living out there lives from the dark depths of the grass.  To the east what
appears to be a village or small town composed from numerous tents can be
seen, while slightly to the southwest a large wooden building stands.  The
plains continue with out a clear end to the north and south.

A polished wooden counter faces the doorway set into the eastern wall. 
Wind chimes hang from the roof, constructed from bone, brass and crystal
each supplying a merry tune when the wind blows through the window set above
the door.  Placed with great care, stringed instruments of all types have
been placed in cases.  A rug woven from grasses and dyed a bright red color
hides most of the packed earth floor.

clearly be seen.  The carvings upon the temple depicted horses, humans and
centaurs living together happily.  To the north and south brightly colored
tents have been pitched upon the plain.

some unseen power watches over it.  You can't be quite sure but it is almost
as if this hall is strangely small.

Four statues of two of horses and two of humans stand facing each other

arched hallway.  The roof seems almost lost high above, painted upon this is
a scene showing humans and horse living in harmony.  A sense of great peace
fills the air here, a calm that goes straight to the mind, not really
registering on any of the senses.  In the space in between the four statues
a large stone has been set, carved smooth.

deep within its depths can be seen.  To both the north and south the grass
lands continues seeming without break.  West of here a large wooden building

countless brightly colored tents can be seen.
