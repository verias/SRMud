drunken moose~
a drunken moose~
A moose drunk from rotting fruit staggers through here.
~
This large four-legged animal can only be a moose, judging by its
slightly equestrian appearance and large hand-like antlers.  It slowly looks
around, standing still as if in a stupor.  When it does move, it lurches a
little, almost as if it has lost its sense of balance and direction.  Its
muzzle is stained purple from plum juice.

A grey squirrel with a bushy tail darts up a tree.

This small creature is covered in short grey fur.  Its hands, feet, and
small rounded ears are marked by black fur and it has a bushy tail that
thrusts itself into the air, the very end curled slightly.  It forages
through the fruit and berries on the ground, picking each up in turn to
study it.

a flower maiden~
Ophelia, the flower maiden, stands here.
~
A woman with straight dark hair and deep green eyes stands behind the
counter.  Her ears seem a little too pointy to be human, but her features
are too bland to mark her as an elf.  She takes care of the plants in the
cabinets whenever she is not tending on customers.  Her clothes are plain
cut and a dark blue but seem to compliment her figure well.  She wears an
apron over her dress, occasionally wiping her hands on it.  Every so often,
her form turns translucent and you can see right through her.

A cruel-looking woman stands here, fingering a wicked whip.

Fiery red hair curls wildly about this woman's form, reaching to well
below her waist.  Her clear blue eyes coupled with a broad smile make her
demeanor pleasant.  She is dressed in a revealing black leather shirt and an
extremely short black leather skirt.  Tied to her belt is a very
mean-looking whip.

The woman that is here, attempting to clean, is translucent.  Her apron
and dress are a muted white and hair is tucked neatly into a cap.  She

The translucent form of a butler can be seen here, standing to attention.

Though he is smartly dressed for his duties, you can see right through
this translucent man.  The features of his face are slightly blurred but his
dark brown eyes still stand out easily.  His lips are pursed, as if he is
deep in thought.  He doesn't seem to notice your presence at all as he
stands to the side of the room, looking as if he is awaiting orders.

pristine white hat.  Her face is stern and thin and she wears a perplexed
look.  She paces endlessly to and fro, though her feet barely touch the
floor.  An apron is tied tightly to her plump figure, making her black dress

The master of the house is here, his form ghostly.
~
A rakishly handsome figure is here.  His faded blue eyes still twinkle
and his hair is in disarray, though it is not unpleasant looking.  He stands
tall and proud, easily cresting six feet in height and possibly taller.  He
is dressed in dark, neat clothing that appears to be tailored to be
form-fitting.  He is rather young-looking for a master of such a large
estate and every now and then, his form becomes nearly transparent before
returning to its translucent state.

The mistress of the house can be seen here, resting regally.
~
Raven hair has been piled artfully at the top of this woman's head,
tucked neatly in a style of the distant past.  She wears a long-sleeved
dress made of fine green silk with full skirts that enhance her already
attractive figure.  Her feet are not visible at all, despite the fact that
she floats inches above the floor.  The features of her face blur when she
moves her head to look at something, only to redefine and display sparkling
green eyes that match her dress and a slightly impish look.

wrinkled by time, and his face is framed with a shock of white hair.  His

covered in a substantial amount of filth that is only a few shades lighter
than his dirty blonde hair.  Large, brown eyes make him look more innocent

A ghostly stable master is sitting here on a stool.

The stablemaster quickly pushes a strand of long, greasy brown hair out
of his dark brown eyes.  He's approximately six feet in height, possibly
more.  His shirt is a dingy brown and looks like it might have originally
been white.  Damen wears a black suede hat and when he grins at you, you
notice that he is missing a few teeth.  His chapps are old and faded and his
boots are scuffed considerably.  Though his form is definitive, his body
shifts between a translucent and solid state.

Though elderly, this woman's fingers still seem quite agile as she
randomly measures objects in her surroundings, ranging from bolts of cloth
to your in-seam.  Her posture is far from perfect and her hair is brown
except for a flash of grey running from her brow into the tight bun at the
nape of her neck.  Complimentary but plain clothes grace her bent figure,
unstained and wrinkle-free.  An apron is arranged over her clothing, holding
her scissors and other sewing supplies at the ready.

A Strange Road~
The road that cuts through the tall trees turns from dirt to the north
into cobblestones leading further south.  The vegetation leaves this pathway
in shade from the best of natural light.  Several colorful leaves have

A small trail works its way westward into the wilderness while the
cobbled pathway runs from north to south.  Ditches hug each side of the
road, partially filled with rain water.  Wild flowers and tall grass grow in
a mix between the road and thick growth of ancient and young trees.  Bushes
full of dark blackberries make venturing into the wood all but impossible.

The Cobbled Way~
Deep ditches for drainage flank the sides of this road, which continues
both northward and southward, where a gigantic tree that has rotted through
has fallen across the cobbled way.  Wild growth spreads from the ditches
into the tall trees that tower above, making movement to the east or west
unthinkable.

A large tree with the diameter of at least ten feet has tipped over,
laying across the cobbled road and exposing its roots to the air.  Its bark,
or what is left of it, is rough and cracked, and long since a food source
for various mosses and fungi.  Despite the tree's impressive size, the
middle has rotted away and provides passage to the south.  The surrounding
vegetation seems to be entirely untouched and thriving, despite the
disruption its original fall must have caused.

allows those that can fit through to continue in that direction.  Cobbled
stone stretches away to the south, with large and stately trees growing
abundantly to the east and west.

Before Wrought-Iron Gates~
Wrought-iron gates that have been overcome with ivy can be found to the
south.  A garden and a mansion of considerable size can be seen beyond the
iron bars.  Uncompromising wilderness comprised of large hardwood trees and
brambles block the east and west.  A cobbled road made of dark grey stones
stretches away to the north.

The Front Garden~
A large statue that has long since been overgrown and eroded stands in
the middle of the garden, its arms outstretched toward the gates as if in
welcome.  A small pond has formed beneath the alabaster figure, either
constructed purposefully or placed there by nature, with leaves that have
fallen from the courtyard trees drifting across the surface.  A flagstone
path wide enough for carriages to pass over with ease runs to the east and
west, around the garden.

A Natural Thoroughfare~
Rough brown bark covers the trees that prevent movement to the north and
south from this dirt trail that has been created by the passage of many
animals, some of them hoofed.  Leaves lay in rotting masses, making the
ground slippery in places as they decompose in a thin film of water.  The
dirt path continues to the west while to the east there is a width of
cobblestone stretching north and south.

A Twisted Deer Trail~
The trail of hoof prints and other visible animal passings twists and
curves here.  At certain points, the black soil of the path is lost under
the rotting foliage and the trail becomes difficult to follow.  Yellow and
white wildflowers struggle with grass to grow in the patches of forest floor
that are fortunate enough to see the light of the sun, their scent drifting
on the slightest breeze.

A Forest Clearing~
Tall grass grows in this small meadow with no discernible path to guide
travellers.  Golden rod mingles with the grass to add bursts of color to the
sea of greenery.  Large trees with colorful blossoms surround the edges of
the small field but do not obstruct natural light from illuminating it.

in places by weeds, left without care for some time.  To the west, a statue
overlooking a pond can be seen clearly, though the figure has suffered
damage.  Eastward, a carriage house and stables can be seen.

doors sits a small pigeon coop, the multiple openings gazing like eyes to
the west.  A path of broken cobbles divides to the south, to what looks
to be a large brown barn and to the west a single willow tree growing in a
courtyard.  A smattering of pigeon mess sits slick and white before the
double doors.

In Margate Stables~
To both the north and south are stalls where the horses of Margate
stables are kept.  Looking over the door gives you a glimpse of the feeding
and water troughs that line the back wall.  The stalls seem large enough for
a horse to turn around, or at the least large enough for someone to fit in
the stall with the horse.  To the west is the way to a flagstone pathway and
to the east leads further into the stable.

floor.  Natural light filters into this building via several windows,
illuminating the stables.  Toward the east end of the building is a large
door and the tack room to the north.  Nailed above the door leading west
onto a flagstone walkway is a large silver horseshoe.

A straw broom has been left leaning against the woodwork between stalls. 
There is a stall to the south and the tack room is to the north.  Westward

or stacked neatly in rows on tables and shelves.  In the back there is a
ladder leading to the hay loft and to the south is the main hall of the
stables.

wooden fence can be seen, marking the edges of the field and serving as a
deterrence to the horses.  Hoof prints can be seen in the grass and dirt of
the floor, leading off in all directions.

The Middle of the Pasture~

hoofed feet.  Here and there some grass still grows, but it has become
stunted.  Off in all directions, lush-looking grass can be seem, dotted
occasionally by the odd bright blossom of some wildflower.  A wooden fence
constructed out of solid-looking bars surrounds the field.  To the west, a
large wooden building stands, this structure looks very much like a barn.

earth is scored by hoof prints, the damage to the earth becoming more
extreme closer to the middle of the field.  Movement further to the north is

rug has a knot-work pattern, silver weaving through the black, with borders
in a matching color.  Several lamps hang from the ceiling, ready to shed
light in the event of there being a lack of it.  Black velvet drapes are
drawn over the windows, the silver sashes that hold them untied.

image with little distortion.  Chairs line the walls and a long table that
must have been used to dispense refreshments has been situated near the
door.  A platform that once held an orchestra is along the southern side of
the room, a fine film of dust covering its surface.  A large crystal
chandelier hangs from the ceiling, fragmenting all the light that shines
through it.

A Store Room~
Instruments covered in a film of dust have been hung off wooden pegs or
rest upon intricate shelving designed to keep them safe.  Chairs have been
stacked neatly and music stands are crowded in the rear of the room.  A
small cabinet without doors is located near the southern wall, sheets of
what seem to be music on the shelves.

A Pantry~
Wooden shelves line each wall, holding boxes full that have long since
been emptied.  Spider webs stretch between several of the shelves, old and
dusty.  A ladder has been set against the eastern set of shelves so that one
may reach the top shelf, and the racks for drying herbs, with ease.  Old
wooden crates and bins have been arranged around the floor of the pantry to
make use of all the available space, excluding a trap door that has been set
into the floor.

The Landing~
Dark blue carpet runs from the foyer's entrance from the north and
continues up each staircase that leads to the second floor.  A large marble
statue is positioned in the center, against the wall, dwarfing the two
antiquated suits of armor that flank it.  Several doors can be seen leading
away from the foyer to the north while the stair case itself curves to wind
upwards to the east and west, heading toward a balcony that overlooks the
foyer.

marble statue~
Ringlets of hair cascade down the naked back of this statue of a woman. 
Amongst the folds of the shift that the marble idol clutches tightly, a rose
in full bloom can be seen.  Her visible foot is resting upon a box inscribed
with the word: Hope.

A bench made of cherry wood and large enough to seat five persons rests
with its back against the balcony's railing.  Directly south is the grand
stair leading up to the second floor, covered in the same deep blue
carpeting as the balcony.  The walls of the second floor have been painted
to seem like the wild woods, only to be broken by doors of wood and glass to
the north.  Lacy curtains cover the doors, muting the natural light that
enters.  The doors seem to lead to an outdoor balcony.

below, the contents growing wildly around a pond and a weathered statue. 
Several willow trees grow in the courtyard below and a greenhouse is visible
from here.  The gates to the premises can be seen, drawn shut and overgrown
with ivy.  Beyond the gate is a cobbled road that leads northward.  The
double doors to the house are set into the southern wall, made of dark wood
with rectangular glass panels that span nearly the entire length of the
door.  Lacy curtains can be seen on the other side of the doorway, obscuring
your view of what lies inside.  A roof has been constructed overhead and is
supported by pillars at the corners of the balcony.  Wind chimes dangle from
one of the cross-beams, twinkling pleasantly in even the gentlest breeze.

black cord decorated with silver crescent moons and stars.  At the end of
the cord is a large silver and amethyst charm.  There are steps that lead
down through a trap door.

Cobweb-clothed crates and rotting sacks litter this dust-filled chamber.
Apples laid down for winter usage have turned to nothing but mush in their
wooden racks.  The smell of decay taints the air, pungent and strong from
wasted food stuffs.  An iron ladder leads upwards, the rungs rusted in
places, while along side this a pulley hangs down, the rope long since gone.
To the north, another area of cellar can be reached by weaving through the
long unused cases and bags.  There is also an open doorway leading westward.

The Wine Cellar~
The north, west and east walls of this cool chamber are all lined with
racks.  Placed carefully into the racks are numerous bottles, each dust
cloaked and cobweb covered.  The pungent odor of vinegar rises from the
cobbled floor, a clear sign one of more bottles has blown its cork, further
evidenced by a small pool of this substance that can easily be seen.  To the
south, the main cellar stretches away.

racks wine~
Each of the three massive racks has been filled with bottles of wine long
ago.  The contents have long since turned to vinegar, in some cases.  Each
of the three racks is covered in dust and cobwebs, making examination of the
bottles difficult.  Added to this, the eastern rack seems unstable.

A Torture Chamber~
A large wooden rack dominates the decor of this room.  A glance around
reveals an array of hooks emerging from the ceiling and walls in an orderly
fashion with thongs of leather looped through some.  Whips and chains are
draped from several other hooks, while others are bare and awaiting a use. 
Several pairs of shackles line the southern wall, polished to a shine and
nestled amongst the jagged edges of the rock.

The Domme's Room~
The walls are made of jagged, black rock and are barely visible in the
dim light.  An exotic throw-rug graces the floor, stretching out in front of
the four-poster that dominates the north-eastern corner of the room.  To the
side of the bed is a mannequin, draped in clothing and utensils of pain.  A
fireplace has been crafted from the eastern wall.  A large oval mirror is
set into the western wall, reflecting what little light there is available.

fireplace~
A grand fireplace has been crafted here, large enough to hold a round of

~
E
mirror~
The flat surface of the mirror shimmers faintly, reflecting more light
into the dimly lit room.  The mirror itself is embedded into the chamber,
taking up the entire vertical length of the wall and spanning well over four
feet at the middle.  
~
E
mannequin~
The mannequin is a headless and armless torso positioned on an iron rod
with hooks and knobs.  Draped over the various hooks and knobs are different
items of clothing, a wicked whip, and other instruments that you can't even
begin to guess the uses for.  
~
E
throw rug~
A large red fur rug stretches across the floor in front of the large bed.
Black stripes reach across the length of the rug, the long fur of it warm
and inviting.

The Laundry Room~
This room is filled with massive copper pots, turned green with time and
moisture.  Next to the coppers are large wooden dolly tubs with the punches
sitting in them.  Wicker baskets sit next to mangles, the wringers stained
and long disused.  Close horses lay against the southern wall, also showing
signs of age.  What once must have been a mighty shove for heating water is
now little more than a corroded lump.  Over next the north wall are ironing
boards, bowed and bend under their weight, and heavy, rusted irons. 
Eastward, a cluttered chamber can be seen.

The Cellar Entrance~
A mansion looms high into the air, being three stories in height, to the
east.  Wooden double doors built on a slant of approximately forty-five
degrees lead downward, into what must be a cellar or underground construct
of some sort.  A somewhat worn grey flagstone path leads to the north,
south, and east, long blades of grass poking out from between the path.

the wooden wheels.  What looks to be a mouse nest can be seen poking out
from under the drives seat of this contraption, made of hay and feathers
that are matted into a ball.  The rest of the room is mostly empty, except
for spare wheels and the trappings to fasten the steeds to the carriage.  A
large set of double doors stand to the west.

A large tree with dark bark and bright blossoms grows here, the trunk
straight and wide.  The blossoms, both those that fell to the ground and
those that are still on the tree, fill the still air with their fragrant
aroma.  A few slats of wood have been nailed together to provide a sturdy
frame from a child's swing that hangs from the lowest branch.  Green blades
of grass poke out from between the flagstone path that veers from south to
east at this point.

This wooden structure is approximately four feet in height and is
L-shaped, covering a large area.  A trough full of filthy water can be found
along one wall of the dog house while a second trough that has been covered
and dust and spider web lines the other.  A few balls made of animal hide
and covered in grime lay on the floor, abandoned.  The entrance to this

A thick grove of hardwood trees growing to the north meets with the
eastern wall, creating an L-shaped path leading west and south.  A three
story mansion can be seen to the west with two towers rising from the south
of it and reaching into the air.  Large fruit trees grow in rows to the
south, planted in rows to create an orchard.

A large hedge to the west and a towering wall to the east limit this
pathway to a strict north-south direction.  Small dusky pink roses can be
seen within the hedge, though they are barely visible.  Lush green grass
grows between the flagstones, adding color to the otherwise desolate ground.
Fruit trees that have once been grown in neat rows can be seen to the south.

Margate Orchard~
Twin lines of cherry trees in full bloom run from the north to the south
forming a corridor over what once must have been a simple track.  Long
grasses flow like water, rippling to the slightest breeze, ready to cast
forth there seeds to the slightest provocation.  Two other paths clearly
lead to the east and the other to the west, heading into what looks very
much like more orchards.  Fragrant blossom drifts down from these trees
fluttering to the grass swathed earth, their scent heavy in the air.

In the Orchard~
New growth of elder trees spring up between what must have been planned
plantings of orange trees, both blossoms mixing upon the floor and in the
air, whenever the wind rises sufficiently to cause them to stir and fall. 
The call of a dove reaches down from one of the trees standing to the
easternmost side of the path, indicating that one must have nested there. 
Nettle and fern grow in competition with the much larger plants, though all
flourish.  A path curves its way from the west to the south here leading
into more, once trained, woodland.

seen cloaked in long grasses and littered with rotten fruit.

The Middle of an Orchard~
What once may have been an enthralling center to this orchard is now in
ruins.  Brambles and briar have sprung up, their sharp thorns like tiny
daggers ready to stab and cut.  Ivy has clawed its way from the earth now
clogging and smothering the very plants that try so hard to support them,
selfishly killing their only chance at life.  Though the trees still stand,
no longer is any resemblance of life evident, as it has been killed totally
by the clinging of the ivy.  Faint paths can still be seen stretching off to
each of the four compass points, littered with weeds and nettles, no longer
easily traversed.

An Unkempt Orchard~
Vines and creepers crawl up the trunks of these once majestic hazel nut
trees.  These parasitic plants slowly kill all life with their roots and
weight, clinging and hugging too tightly to the noble tree.  Yet life is
still evident within the mighty plants as new shoots and growth show
through.  Three tracks lead off to the north, south and west, each appearing
to head into more of the orchard.

An Orchard~
Gnarled branches intermix within the canopy of the orchard here, the
trees once having been fine plum now look wild beyond belief.  Ivy vines
have spread over the fruit-littered floor, forming a natural carpet of
sorts.  What once must have been the path through the orchard splits north,
south and east here, each leading to other sections of the grounds.  The
sweet odor of rotting fruit rises up onto the air, cloying to the senses.

In Margate's Orchard~
A path from the north meets an overgrown east-western track at about the
middle, all of which are surrounded by dense ferns and massive trees.  The
trees all seem to be plum and once must have formed orderly lines though now
this has been some what lost with their wild, uncontrolled growth.  From
within the fern bed the sounds of small animals moving can be heard, it is
likely that these creatures are feasting contentedly upon the fallen fruit. 
Small plants bearing blueberries can be seen growing close to the ground.

The Orchard~
What once must have been a well kept segment of orchard is now little
more than a wild copse of trees.  Where once delicious fruit grew, now feral
vines choke; where once delicate blossoms flourished, vicious thorns run
rampant.  What may have been pleasant and pleasing to the owners now seems
to be in the grip of nature's hand.  Nettle and hogweed grow to shocking
proportions here, their poisoned spines waiting to catch the unwary.  What
remains of the trail leads both north and west.

Mighty apple trees grow all around the north-east path that curves its
way here.  The apple blossoms flutter down in the slightest draft or
swirling madly like confetti at some rowdy wedding.  The scents from these
blooms rise from the trees and the floor, where they lay scattered, to
mingle with the scent of old fruit left to rot upon the ground.  Wild
blackberry bushes grown thickly between these monolithic trees, their
creepers reaching skywards in an attempt to gain access to more light while
spreading towards the path.

leading south into the garden.  White blooms line both sides of the marble
path as it stretches away, making the dark veins stand out further. 
Flagstones that have bright green grass growing between them lead off to the
west and north.

of leaves and other matter.  Four long wicker seats have been placed in
here, not appearing to be too weak from age to hold a person's weight. 
Terracotta pots stand about this room, now filled with dead plants, the
steams and dehydrated leaves littering the red stone tiled floor.  A single
glass door is set into the southern wall, leading to a garden path.

headily in the still air.  Now and then, the sound of some unseen creature

supports a magical globe of light overhead, providing illumination as
needed.  A flagstone path can be seen to the north.

The heady scents of these plants float in the still air, adding something
akin to a dream-like quality to the path.  Everything appears almost

keeping the plant life orderly.

A fountain bubbles endlessly in this small clearing.  The water pouring

provides the ideal bird bath, as one can guess from the birds fluttering
around it.  Easily discernible in the water are several feathers and leaves,
but otherwise the liquid looks perfectly clear.  Gently-curving
semi-circular wooden benches are situated around the fountain, providing a
spot for comfortable rest.  There is an exit in each cardinal direction into
the hedge work, one identical to the next.

left their marks upon it, where the left arm should have been now there is
only a smooth stump; dead leaves and creepers strive to over run the shapely
legs of the figure, giving more an impression now that it is being consumed
by nature than rising from the waters.  Rounded stones set into the ground
lead northward to a hedge maze.

The white marble path rises slightly in its center here following the
natural contorts of the land, equally the thick green foliage that flanks
either side of this rises too.  Stout iron poles have been placed here, each
topped with a single ball of magical light so that even in the dead of night
the path could be seen.  Delicate flowers of the softest yellow line either
side of the path, through there size is tiny they emit a powerful and heady
aroma into the air.

An Intersection~
A crook of iron is set into the soil upon which hangs an orb of enchanted
light, the radiance from it able to brighten the walkway even the darkest
nights.  Twin dense green hedges stand either side of a black veined marble
path from in which small blooms the color of sunshine yellow poke out.  The
scent from these posies drifts upon the air.  Due to the considerable height
of the hedges only the path's route may be discerned.

A Dead End~
The hedges enclose this area on three sides, making a dead end.  Lilac
flowers peek out from the thick hedge, breaking the wall of green into a
pattern all of its own.  A black iron post with a curving top has been
spiked into the ground.  From the crook, it bears a globe of magical
luminescence that ensures that there is light here at all times.  White
marble, veined delicately with black, leads off to the east.

A Dead End~
What once must have been a carefully cultivated rosebush now sprawls
here, its flowers shrunken and its thorns like tiny blades.  The scent of
this massive bush's numerous flowers fill the air, a painful lure to anyone
not paying attention to the spiked limbs.  Peeking out from under the
multitude of runners is what once must have been a bench, now inaccessible
except for the smallest of creatures.  To the north a white marble path
works its way between high green hedges.

A Dead End~
A fountain bubbles endlessly in this small clearing.  The water pouring
fourth from the statuette is of white marble into a generous basin below
provides the ideal bird bath, as one can guess from the birds fluttering
around it.  Easily discernible in the water are several feathers and leaves,
but otherwise the liquid looks perfectly clear.  Gently-curving
semi-circular wooden benches are situated around the fountain, providing a
spot for comfortable rest.  There is an exit to the south.

A Dirt Path~
This stretch of dirt road curves west to south through the forest,
leaving a clear path that is wide enough for wagons traveling through. 
Holly and iron oaks touch branches overhead, leaving the road in a pleasant
shade during day and overshadowed at night.  Orchids wind their way through
the branches, adding a splash of color to the brown and green surroundings.

A Broken Bridge~
Orange-pink walls bedecked in numerous small, stunted plants cling to the
rock face, attempting to survive in this harsh environment.  Sun-bleached
chunks of wood and metal have become embedded behind some of these plants
and within the craggy face of the canyons walls.  What once must have been a
bridge is now little more than a skeleton of what it once was, useless for
foot travel.

A Dirt Pathway~
A wide cave opening can be seen to the south, leading straight into the
mountain to a mica-flecked tunnel.  A dirt road stretches from the tunnel's
mouth and curves to the east.  Ivy climbs the mountain walls, displaying its
green and white leaves proudly.  Water trickles down aside these vibrant
plants, making the mica in the rock shine even more brilliantly against the
near-blackness of the wet rock.

A Cavernous Pathway~
This cavern ends abruptly here, with a large cave mouth allowing in the
natural light of the sun, moon, and stars.  When the outside light filters
in alone, the mica in the walls is barely visible, but with the addition of
any other light, they sparkle and glisten in the dark rock.  The cavern
continues to the south for an undefinable length.

A Tunnel~
Dark grey stone makes up this looming tunnel, broken only by small pieces
of mica embedded into the walls that glint in the presence of the faintest
light that should happen across it, akin like some forgotten treasure.  The
air feels cool opposed to truly cold, most likely an effect of the earth and
rock all around.  Something in the still air seems to echo of a tomb, maybe
the silence--or possibly the dry dust.

Mica-flecked Tunnel~
Mica-flecked grey rock walls surround this tunnel, the speckled rock
glinting in any light like gems from a king's vault.  This path must have
been crafted long ago with great skill, as little, if any, wear is now
visible upon it.  A coldness radiates from the rock walls, a product of the
weight of the mountain above this corridor that blocks any hope of day
light's touch here.  Faintly the distant howl of the wind can just be heard.

The bright orange-pink walls are devoid of much to grab hold of, though
they have small ledges filled with plant life lining them in a pleasing
disarray.  Above, a bridge that has been torn apart has been built, now
useless to any travelers on foot.  Below, a deep canyon can be seen plainly,
leading in an east-west direction.

The canyon walls are steep and craggy, a bright orange-red.  Plant life
struggles to grow in the crevices where soil has collected, some of which
look to be near death due to lack of water and an abundance of sun.  The
trench continues east and west.  Far above, a bridge can be seen, broken in
the middle and useless.

At the Bottom of a Precipice~
A boulder surrounded by several stones have been clustered together
toward the center of this small opening, though the visible trail to the
west is narrower still.  The sheer coral colored rock destroys all hopes of
further passage in all other directions above ground, though the cracks and
ledges of the wall provide homes to several thriving plants.

A Fork~
Dead wood and boulders have fallen to the rock floor of this pit,
littering the canyon and making the path more difficult to travel.  High
coral walls stretch up to the distant sky, craggy and broken in places so
that small, stunted scrubs and bracken have attempted to make their homes
there.  A winding path leads off to the north and east arching its way
between this rock faces.  The lack of moisture and wind gives the air the
same quality as that from an oven.

This path ends with a sheer cliff face, coral in color.  Uneven spots in
the wall harbor plants struggling for life and a bird, if the tweeting
echoing off the walls is any indicator.  There is what appears to be a hole
or small alcove at the base of the rock formation, barely visible due to an
overhang that blends in with the rest of the rock surroundings.  The canyon
opens up to the south at a fork.

A Dead End~
This path between the coral canyon ends in an uncompromising wall that is
devoid of all plant life.  There is a loose layer of arid soil covering the
stone floor, littered by fallen rocks and desiccated wood that has been
greatly disturbed by the passage of some creature.  The air is still here
and carries the taint of something unfamiliar.  There is a pathway that
leads to a fork at the north.

A small hole can be seen in the wall, more noticeable when there is
daylight striking the ground beyond the small overhang.  The coral rock of
the wall stretches overhead and forms barriers to the south and west,
leaving a yawning blackness in the other directions, though the darkness is
not oppressive.  The air is chilled but still and filled with an odd but
faint scent.

Walls of jagged rock can be seen to the east and west while darkness

lost in this static atmosphere, the darkness neither threatening or
oppressive.  Silver threads can be seen covering spots of the wall, glinting
faintly in any available light.

Stygian darkness flows all around, somewhat like a river within the
earth's depths; no feeling of time or space can truly be grasped for long. 
Moments down here might be ages above without the sun and moon's aid for it
is all but impossible to tell while submerged within this blackness.  The
occasional silvery thread of some silk-like substance can be seen, glinting
faintly in any present light.

Silvery webbing glistens moistly in this dry-aired chamber, each strand
stretching from its anchor point up to the jagged rock face so as to best
entrap the careless.  Here and there the cocoon of of a creature that has
become ensnared can be seen, neatly hanging or resting about the chamber.  A
strange stillness fills the air, allowing the spider webs to sit resplendent
in their places.

The rock walls seem to be crumbling here, spilling over the ground
haphazardly.  Thick strands of some wet thread-like substance stretch from
their craggy surfaces to the uneven jags all around, making it difficult to
move without touching the webbing.  The darkness stretches away to the east
and south, though it is impossible to determine how far.  All sense of time
is elusive in the darkness that enshrouds this place, making it difficult to
judge any distances traveled within.

stretched across this hole hang tattered and broken, wavering gently in the
presence of a draft.  The cavern stretches on indefinitely to the south and
west, shrouded in darkness that obstructs all concept of time and space.

Shrouded in Darkness~
Darkness fills this chamber, broken only by innumerable spider webs--each
perfect in its own right and lethal, going by the bodies hanging lifeless
from them.  The rock walls can just be made out through this webbing, sharp
and broken to become another hazard to any that wish to move through this
space.  A strange odor fills the air, mixed with that of death, something
akin to what you would expect in a bee's hive only somehow different and
more sinister.

Spider silk has been woven expertly into a grand web here, clinging to

A coral barrier blocks passage to the east, while darkness stretches away in
the other directions.

easily destroy all sense of time and direction, though it does not give off
a threatening feeling.

Shrouded in Webs~
Cocoons containing unfortunate souls litter this area, each wrapped
within their own burial shrouds of silk and encased within the dehydrating
still moistureless air.  A few tree branches have, at some point, been
brought to this area, each of which are also covered in shimmering spider's
silk.  The stillness to this chamber is only broken by a faint scraping
sound, though no source to this noise can as yet be easily determined. 
Upward, the faint hole of a tunnel can be seen, shrouded almost entirely in
spiderweb.

Wrapped in Silk~
Silk strands drift and waft here, lacking any form of moisture and only
moving to the drafts created by the movements of a person or creature within
this chamber.  Mounds of webbing indicate that something or someone has
become entombed within the delicate-looking thread.  The occasional branch
has been brought into this chamber, apparently for the purpose of being
covered with yet more webbing, which can be seen stretching up to the
surrounding walls.

A Dread Spider's Web~
Rictus masked bodies festoon the web-shrouded earth of this area,
grinning eternally in death now that their moans and screams for help have
long since died with them.  Dehydrated beyond life, or any close
approximation thereof, bushes and trees have been dragged here so more of
the ever-present webbing can be spun effectively for a larger death trap. 
The air sits still and heavy with the decay from the demise of the doomed
denizens of this web-encrusted area.

hangs heavily upon the still air, invading the senses of any creature that
passes this way.  Every so often, the faint sound of movement can be heard,
though the source remains unseen.

substance stretch up and over pieces of dried tree and other fallen wood
adding a crazy labyrinth effect.  Death's foul odor fills the still air,
cloying the senses.

What once must have been a large tree is now nothing but a desiccated
husk here, shrouded in spider silk.  Hanging from the highest branch and
dangling down is the lifeless body of a lamb, its head pointing to the floor
as it rocks ever so slightly.  Mounded around this visage of death is a
delicate weave of webbing, each of which seems to contain its own burden of
death.  An odd odor fills the air, musty and dry--much like one might expect
if you cracked an ants nest open, only far stronger.

Dried out bodies lay or stand entombed in glimmering spiders silk,
imprisoned in this pit forever more by some deadly beast.  The bodies of
goats have been wrapped helpless next to human, haitorin and tervadi; all
have met the same doom within this cavern.  Fallen wood and trees have been
dragged here to help with the weaving of these gigantic webs, each coated in
its own covering of sticky fibers, all woven with the greatest care.  The
air here smells oddly dry lacking any real hint of moisture.

Matted Webbing~
Glimmering strands of webbing stretch randomly about this chamber,
reaching up to walls and ceiling in what can, to a normal mind, only be a
haphazard manner.  Lumps litter the floor and hang helplessly suspend from
the ceiling, wavering gently as something unseen touches them, such as a
draft.  Looking more closely, the desiccated corpses of creatures may be
seen within these cocoons.  No movement or moisture can be detected within
the air of this chamber, giving it an unhealthy feel.

Tangled Webs~
What appears to be most of a coach or wagon has somehow come to its final
rest within this area, now bedecked in shimmering webbing and unable to be
moved without a great deal of effort.  Hanging in bundles from the roof
close to it are what once appeared to have been its horses and teamsters,
now nothing more than mummies cocooned.  Spider's silk covers the wall and
ground and is woven through the air, crossing over each other in thick
bolts.  Barely visible in the far corner is a hole leading downward.

The Dread Spider's Lair~
Sticking up like bones are the limbs of dehydrated plants, dried long ago
and dragged here by some unseen hand.  Encrusting these plants are
innumerable spider silk webs, each shimmering in any light that glances over
them.  Cocooned in these webs are masked forms that look humanoid in shape,
the lack of movement hints that these might be the fallen victims of this
lair.  A stillness hangs in the dry air, undisturbed by the slightest
breeze.
