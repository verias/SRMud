you a wide, toothless grin.  That grin doesn't look like the kind of grin

Stream wandering through the jungle.~
The river shrinks to little more than a stream here.  Large tree
branches hang low over your head.  The bugs are so thick that it is
difficult to breath in without sucking them into your lungs.  Water lilies
begin to clog the stream.  Frogs of all sizes and colors sit on the lily
pads.  Navigation is very difficult.

Narrow Path Through the Banana Plants~
The huge plants on either side eerily loom over the path as if they are
going to swallow whole anything that passes through.  It is getting more and
more difficult to continue to the east.  To the west the path is a bit
wider.  Closely spaced banana plants provide living walls to the north and
south.

Old Field Hand's Hut~
This is someone's small home.  It doesn't look very comfortable although
it affords some shelter from the weather.  The walls are made of dried
banana leaves and the floor is bare dirt.  A single rocking chair, a straw
mat, and a large rose-wood chest are the only furnishings.  Leaning against
the far wall is a faded photo of a young bride carrying a bouquet of golden
Bonchita flowers.

Exceptionally Large Banana Plant~
Broad-leafed banana plants stand tall and provide cool shade from the
hot sun.  Long clumps, each containing upwards of twenty individual bananas
grow near the tops of the plants.  At the base of the plant, the stalk is

Besides your weight, they carry carcasses of some amazingly large prey.  The
bones are picked clean and some have been bleached white from a long stay in
the sun.  You find it difficult to move around here.  Your feet stick to the

This is a very thin trail.  You find it difficult to move in the thick
underbrush.  Thorns tear at your clothing and scratch your exposed flesh. 
The ground is covered with soft green moss.  A sturdy looking {Gvine{x hangs
down.  It is slightly sticky to the touch.  You might be able to climb it. 
You can't go any further on the ground in any direction except through the
thin trail to the east.  You can barely make out a low growling sound over
the sound of the river to the east.  It seems to be coming from somewhere
above you.  A strange odor assaults your nostrils.

The path leads to the river's edge here.  The calm, still water lies to
the east.  Ginko trees stand on the bank providing a barrier for the
village.  To the north stands the remains of a hut.  Large patches of thatch
have been ripped off the frame.  It doesn't look very inhabitable now.

belches out lava periodically to the south-east.  Small elven children are

Shaman's Cave~
Small glowing orbs give off an ethereal light.  This is the cave of the
village amaru and her apprentices.  The shaman of this tribe have always
been amaru (women shaman).  The smell of blood is very strong here.  A
monkey carcass lays on a rock and a wooden cup is collecting the blood as it
oozes from a slit in it's throat.  Piles of roots and flowers lay within
easy reach of mats on which sit the Amaru and her apprentices.  Near the
back of the cave are rows of urns large enough to hold a small body.  It is
rumored that the bodies of past Amaru are stored here.  The present amaru
calls on the powers in the urns when casting her most powerful spells.

On the Ebony Sea~
You are floating on an ebony sea.  It seems to give more buoyancy than
normal salt water.  The water is shimmering black and comfortably warm.  It
extends as far as you can see to the north.  To the south the shoreline is
carved out by a deep {Ggreen{x rainforest.

On the Sand Near the River~
You step onto the warm glittering sand.  It is surprisingly difficult to
move around on it.  You sink a little at each step and you have to tug hard
to free yourself from it's grip.  Off to the west is a strange looking patch
of sand, and beyond that is a large clearing Several antelope are grazing on
rich green grass.  To the east the opal river rushes northward.

Stuck in the Quicksand~
Now you are seriously stuck in the sand.  You feel yourself being pulled
downwards.  The more you struggle the more you sink.  Just out of reach is a
large vine that you could use to pull yourself to safety.  If only you could
reach it.  You hear the sound of rushing water to the east.  Overhead, a
small monkey seems to be laughing at you.

Drowning in the Quicksand~
You have been sucked down into the quicksand.  Sand fills your nostrils
and your ears.  When you open your mouth to scream you inhale sand.  The
more you struggle the more firmly the sand pulls you down.  This could be
the end here!

Bromeliad Cup~
An impressive bromeliad forms a cup large enough for a dwarf and his
friend to hide in.  Large emerald-colored leaves catch the rain and drain it
into the cup made from the tightly overlapping stiff leaves.  It is rumored
that the illusive Golden Frog uses these plants to mate and lay their eggs. 
The opal-colored river flows from the east and turns north here.

Through the Village~
The path through the village continues north and south.  To the east you
hear something rather large splashing in some water.  To the west is a wide
open field.  You catch a whiff of sulfur in the air.  Looking off to the
east you see, in the distance, a huge black mountain.  Steam rises from the
peak and occasionally a loud rumble is followed by a short burst of lava.

Atop A Rock Outcropping~
Atop of this stone outcropping, the jungle has been stopped of further
growth only by the lack of soil on the bare rock.  Northwards, the jungle
can be seen, closing in with seemingly overwhelming thickness.  Cut into the
jungle and barely visible from this location, a narrow footpath leads up to
a comfortable looking log cabin.

A Sparsely Furnished Living Room~
Strong wood makes up this log cabin, shining delicately with varnish. 
The floor is bare and smooth, giving view to haphazard patterns in the
boards.  The eastern end of the room serves as a cooking corner, containing
a wide wooden counter and nothing more.  The center of the room is occuppied
by a medium-sized table with four comfortable wooden chairs that stand
around it.  The chirping of nearby songbirds can be heard echoing softly
through the air, that, accompanied with the delicate roar of a nearby
waterfall and the sounds of the jungle, creates a harmony of sounds which is
soothing to the extreme.  The rectangular shape of this living room leaves a
lot of free space to walk around in, purposely, judging by the arrangement
of the furniture.  There is a large painting hung on the southern wall,
about two feet away to the west of the door, and in front of it on the
northern wall is a modest bookcase.  The door to the south is made of thick
oak and is straddled by large windows, while the doors to the east and to
the west are significantly more modest.

A Spacious Studio~
The wooden floor ends abruptly behind the door, giving room for smooth
rock.  Two windows, one on the eastern window and one on the northern,
provide light during the daytime, when the many oil lanterns that have been
scattered throughout the room are not required.  A large painting lies on
the northern wall, just beside the window.  A comfortable straw chair sits
in front of a smallish desk which is apparently used to make designs of some
sort.  On the ground are slabs of rock with varying sizes that have not yet
been worked, but judging by the various depressions and cuts on them, it
appears that they will not stay shapeless until long.  A simple wooden door
leads to the west.

The Bedroom~
A short, narrow passageway leads to a large and comfortable bed.  The
wooden walls shine gently with varnish, giving this bedroom a very cozy
feel.  A good sized cabinet rests against the eastern wall and a fairly
large wardrobe rests against the western, complete with a sturdy looking
lock.  There are two windows in this room, one to the north and one to the
east, letting in both the light of day and the lively sounds of the jungle. 
Hanging from the southern wall is a large painting, and a small wooden door
exits to the east.
