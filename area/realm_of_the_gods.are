Kiki is a very very sad monkey.  For some reason or another, he's been

streaming down his little monkey face.  As Kiki looks up at you, a strong
rememberance of what has gone on in his life overwhelms him.  He looks
almost suicidal in this tedious state of mind.  You get a feeling that he
doesn't like violence, and will do whatever it takes to stop it.  So have no
fear, Kiki is here.

sparrow and lies down.  Even when lying his eyes are in constant search of
danger.

The knee-buckling gaze of the Undead is the first thing you notice about
Krass.  He stands haunched on his dead legs.  He is 7 feet tall, with no
hair what so ever.  His bones stand out beneath his thin dead skin that has
turned into a color of sickening green.  His nails are long and dirty and
his teeth are jagged and sharp. And his milky yellow eyes stare directly at
you.  
Krass stands before you looking at you as though your his next meal.

~
Before you crouches a massively furred form.  Huge shoulders and lean
haunches capped with a sharply featured head and a long, whisking tail that
add up to almost ten feet in length.  The color of his coat is deep black in
color, and almost seems to suck in all of the available light around him. 
Long pointed claws extend from the fingers of his hands and the tips of his
toes, each claw almost four inches long.  Glittering within his mouth is a
large set of very sharp and bright white teeth, visible even as his lips
draw back into a snarl and you hear a low growl coming from him.  One
remarkable thing about this wolf though is his eyes.  They are an odd icy
blue color, one which serves to hide all inner feelings of this great beast.

closely~
A magnificent craftsmanship lies before you. It is an iron dagger with
an ivory hilt and a breathtaking black ruby is embeded to the very end of
the hilt. Small and detailed carvings are embeded into the blade creating
magnificent and complex patterns. The ruby glows softly spreading
shadows instead of light, the shadows seem to mock you with their wierd and
misplaced forms. The dagger is so sharp it seems like it will brake with
first impact but as you feel the blade you are certain it will penetrate
even the strongest armor. As you hold the dagger a vision of a huge and
evil man striking down a hopeless child appears before you, he laugh as he
stabs the kid to death. The vision vanishes and you suddenly know this is
the dagger of Acsis the cruel, created by the gods of evil themselves to
serve the forces of evil.
~

carving~
As you examine the carvings closely you can make out some writing between
all of the patterns.  It reads: He who will wield this dagger will do so for
life, and he will bring evil to the land.  He of good heart will not be able
to wield the powers of the gods.  So said the prophecy of Krass.  So shall
be done

prosperous and wonderful place to live, I thank you from the bottom of my
heart.  For always striving for Order and Justice, I again thank you.  May
your rule here be long and filled with wonder and excitement, yet may you

Good luck and fortune to you in wherever your life will take you, and with
whoever you choose to travel there with.
 
Your friend,

the~
At the beginning the Great Creator created the world and populated it
with beings called by us humans, "The Ancient Ones".  "The Ancient Ones" as
we call them are called so, because when the Great Creator created us humans
and other creatures to populate the world, The Ancient Ones were already
ancient and wise and they guided us through life when we were still frail
and sick.  That was a time before evil when all races lived in harmony and
unison.  But the Great Creator was not happy with the new creatures, humans,
he created.  They were too dependent and needful.  They could not accomplish
great things and ivolve, and so he created sleep and with it he created
Dream Space and The Lord of Dreams.  The Great Creator solution worked. 
Humand became strong and proud they began questioning the Ancient Ones rule
upon them.  The Ancient Ones who saw that their control and power was slipping
away from them, and who were already jealous with the great sansetion of
sleep that the humans told them about, tried to go to The Great Creator and
ask for sleep of him, but The Great Creator was already away from the world
in his eatheral sleep.  So all The Ancients Ones came together to meet in
what was later known as "The Meeting of The Ancients".  There they decided
that they wont let the lesser races escape their control and disrupt the
normal way of life.  They decided to force their will on them, and when and
when the first Ancient One, who's name was lost in time forced his will upon
the first elf EVIL came to the world for the first time.  For The Ancient
ones broke the Creators balance and the result was evil in the world.  As
evil came the beautiful Ancient Ones, filled themselves with darkness for
controlling people was far more easy with the darkness inside.  And so they
became ugly and corrupt, nightmares upon the earth.  In the great war they
spawned creatures of darkness to help them, and from their unholy unions
came monsters to the world.  And so they Ancient Ones became corrupt because
of the jealousy in humans and the need to control.

   To my old friend Maglos Dakkton, Baron of the kingdom of Discordia.
Greetings, my friend, it has been long since we last spoke.  Were I
not held up with urgent duties, I would have come to see you personally,
but unfortunately my time is a resource these days more than it once
was.  You may remember me as the ragtag representative of the Guild of
Magic who came calling on King Tanos' domain so long ago.  I saw great
promise in your neck of the woods, such as it was.  Unfortunately, it
would appear that I had left too soon, for all news of the guild in
your realm has ceased to reach our ears.  You held the rank of Wizard
once for the organization, and I would ask that you do it again.  I,
unlike my peers here, still have faith in your abilities.  May fortune
shine upon you always.

strange calm. You find yourself hovering in the calm eye of a hurricane. All
around you you can see the desruction caused by the powerful storm. White
hot flashes of lightning flicker from the depths of the hurricane.  But
everything is strangely peaceful in here, with the sun shining in from above
and a flock of birds winging across the sky.  You stretch out and relax, this
storm is going to be here a while.

Books, more books then you can possibly imagine cover every available

cluttered bookshelves and into stacks on the floor.  Despite the clutter,
the room has a cozy feel to it, with a small fire burning in the fireplace
set flush with the wall.  Looking around, you can see the great deal of
knowledge and wisdom contained in these volumes, and you wonder what a
Goddess of deceit would find so interesting.  Then you notice the small

you are protected from the weather in your cozy cave.  The foamy surf
never seems to quite reach your feet.  Several boulders here have been

The air here is damp, moist, and smells odd.  Not bad, in fact, it smells
quite good.  Off in the corner, a small wood-burning oven has been set into
the wall, and inside is a large pizza.  In the middle of the room, a large
table has been set up with a red checkered tablecloth.  A bed lies unmade in
the opposite corner of the oven, and a large couch sits about 4 feet south
of it on the wall.  The floor is covered in thick shag carpeting, and random
posters of Elvis Presley, Marylin Monroe, and others hang on the wall.  The
area around the bed looks like it was warped into the room.  All of the
other parts of this room are clean and organized, save for the bed area.  A
small, round wooden door has been carved in the floor near the bed, and from
it loud music can be heard.  And above, another round door has been carved,

You are now standing on a barren mountain, with no life, no-one.  It is all
very quiet, and nothing seems to change.  The sky is covered in darkness,
and yet the heat is hardly bareable.  Yet, a small path leads back home.

gigantic bookshelf lined with books.  Hovering near the top of the room is a
small ball, glowing the same faint color as the rest of the room.  To the
left is a case, and upon further inspection it is found to be a weapons
rack.  Upon each item within are a multitude of runes and crawling
writing, which one might recognize as mage script.  Directly opposite
of the weapons rack is an open cabinet in which various jars and
bottles are shelved.  To the side of the cabinet is what looks like a
workstation.  Various pieces of equipment, mundane and mage, are sorted and
stocked.  In the middle of the room a mass of swirling, shifting

A Crease in Time~
You have come to the legendary Crease in Time.  Folks from all worlds,
realms, dimensions, and timelines come from near and far to gather here and
associate themselves with their fellow space/time groupies.  The place
itself is not exactly as most people imagine it.  It pretty much like a pub
of the future, and since you cannot find anything special about it, you
decide it must have some kind of advantage in its position: Take a left at
Vega and head three light years toward Ursa Minor.  The tables are
positioned so that they float directly between two magnets, but some force
yet to be discovered by your kind holds them from moving in the four
cardinal directions.  The chairs are made of a cold metal, and the bar
hovers a bit above the ground so it may be manipulated to suit the
atmosphere.  The air smells of a strange ale.  One that is attractive to all
comers.

The magnets are large, though not easily visible.  They protrude only
slightly from the ceiling and floor, giving them the affect that they are
simple tiles, and not holding up the tables at which people are sitting. 
They have systems in them to keep the magnetic field balanced so that the
tables do not sink when extra weight is applied, but apart from the obvious
display of technological advance, the magnets also serve as theraputic
tools, working on the iron in the blood to sooth tense emotions.

You enter the cottage and are almost blinded by the contrast to the night
outside.  As your eyes adjust you notice that this is the oddest "cottage",
if that is the right word for such a place, that you have ever been in.  The
light seems at first to come from the walls, but then you notice that it's
simply reflected from the single fireplace in the far wall by walls that
seem to be made of pure glass.  No, they seem to be made of crystal, yes,
pure crystal.  Trapped within the walls and ceiling are veins of silver and
obsidian, giving the light an almost stellar quality.  The floor seems to be
the only exception in this 'glass house', being made of pure black marble,
polished so highly that it reflects the light as well as absorbs all the
shadows.  Even in the midst of so many odd things, you feel safe from the
chill night outside, even as a wolf howls in the distance.

Almost complete darkness shrouds this room of obscurity.  It is hard to

beyond, which is covered with several devious devices of of torture.  The
room smells of blood, charred flesh, and incense.  What can be seen of the
walls shows them curving upward in a dome-like fashion.  The ceiling is open
showing the blood red sky of another world.  Thousands of blazing stars
shine above constantly changing position.  Hair raising screams can be heard
from all around...  Alas this is just a tomb resting in the eccho side.
