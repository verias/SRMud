grimbold hardened dwarf~
Grimbold~
This hardened dwarf gives you a wry smile as you look around.
~
This dwarf has steely grey eyes that don't seem to miss anything.  His hair 
is long and it matches his beard in length, both of which flow past 
mid-torso.  The ends of his mustache have been braided to keep them neat, 
each one ending in a small brass ring to capture the hair in that shape.  
Another ring can be seen piercing his left nostril, gleaming under any 
available light.  His white hair and wrinkled skin makes him seem older, but 
oddly enough, that has not equated into a huge beer gut.

Smeegum~
A dwarf with fiery red hair is here.
~
This stocky dwarf has somewhat curly red hair, some of which has been tamed 
into tight braids.  His blue eyes focus on you like a hawk on its prey, 
watching your every move from where he stands within his shop.  He seems to 
have been outfitted by his friend Grimbold, who can be found to the south of 
this shop.

ammachi woman young meditative~
Ammachi~
A meditative young woman rests on a cushion here.
~
A woman rests before you on a mass of pillows, her eyes are closed as she 
mutters words under her breath in a soothing chant.  Wearing a flowing white 
sari, she is covered and draped in layers of chiffon, silk, and everything 
is soft and wispy.  Her features are soft and lax as she opens her mild and 
understanding eyes, smiling at you as she spreads her arms in welcome and 
gestures for you to rest across the table from her, her every move producing 
a very faint tinkling sound.  She introduces herself as Ammachi and spreads 
her cards out before you on the table.  A scent of jasmine and freesia 
emenates from her, sifting the air to reach you each time she moves.

mahadeva haitorin feline female regal~
Mahadeva~
A regal-looking white haitorin female is here.
~
Here stands a sleek white cat with long, kempt fur.  She wears purple 
clothing that barely covers her breasts and spacious pants that make her 
seem slimmer than possible for a cat.  She has long white hair, like a 
human's, braided in small braids that create a cloud of hair around her 
head.  A few of the braids have black streaks in them.  Her nose is covered 
with a purple veil, which her violet eyes stare at you over.  Her feet are 
bare, letting her walk noiselessly.  The sway to her hips and her graceful 
stride give the impression that she is a dancer.  Her fluid movements only 
make her presence seem that more surreal.  She gives you a sultry half-smile 
that reeks of confidence, the tip of her long tail twitching playfully.  Her 
voice is deep and tantalizing as she offers you a softly breathed, "Hello," 
getting close enough to you to make you shiver.

Mayhem~
A haitorin with dichromatic eyes is here, looking wild and unkempt.
~
This haitorin is covered in black and white fur that stands on end, each 
strand standing up like a little spike.  His eyes spin wildly much of the 
time and don't seem to be the same color as one another, either.  He can 
often be heard muttering about Mahadeva, a look of adoration covering his 
fine feline features whenever this occurs.

This gypsy man seems to be eyeing your coin pouch.

Well into his middle age this man still has a certain rugged charm, maybe
it's his rakish grin upon sighting you or maybe it's the twinkle in his eye.
Unkempt black hair crowns his head and his dark brown eyes seem able to
stare into your very soul.  His build is lean most likely due to missing one
or two too many meals and his skin bears a healthy tan which must have come
from hours out doors.

a deckhand~
A deckhand is swabbing the deck.
~
The deckhand, though young in years, is stooped from swabbing the deck
and being beaten by his superiors.  His legs are bowed, and his mouth
rotten, after effects of chronic scurvy.  To add insult to injury, the
sailor's hair is lousy and his shirt is bare and torn.  He glares at you and
bares his teeth in an animal-like sneer.

pale young face.  A pair of {Gemerald green{x eyes draw a decent share of
attention, similarly to her {rblood-red{x lips.  However, Ayleen is only too
familiar with her beauty, as well as, perhaps, her father's great wealth.

is usually the result of some argument with her parents.

defeated Imbolg and his evil troupes.  The statue is very detailed and it
almost feels as if his eyes are taking in your presence.  Rhyygen Ydd was a
large man with unruly red hair.  In the confusion of battle some of his
enemies mistook the red hair that was sticking out the sides of his helmet
for fingers of fire and mistakenly believed that he was a god.  Most of his
foes were very fearful at just the sight of him.  He used this fear to his
advantage and became a very successful warrior.

My master is considering taking on a new disciple.  All are being
considered, even those already in a religion.  There is no worldly
incentive.  It is predestined for some.  Those who feel you may be meant to
follow him may wish to inquire further.  Feelings are fleeting though, and
to cut down the search, those normally who join have been found to be wise,
knowledgeable, and normally have a good command of the history of our world
(though to some this history is learned later).  Please contact me if you
feel you should.

A Little Hole Under the Bridge~
Here under the supports and planks of the bridge has been carved a little
niche in the dirt of the river bank.  Tamped earth sides and floor, it is
nothing more then a simple shelter from the elements.  At the mouth of the
cave-like area is a firepit, a circle of scorched stones.  Against the back
back wall is a pile of rags and pine boughs - a rough bed of some sort.  The
river rushes just a few feet away from the mouth of the little shelter, and
the only exit appears to be a steep and winding trail back up the riverbank.

This dark and sparsely furnished room glows faintly in shadow due to one

consists of rumpled sheets and a thin, well-worn mattress.  Various glinting 
chains of metal which end in straps or spikes hang from the wall mimicking 
tapestries.  There is a distinct feeling of forboding and menace in this 
darkened but comfortable chamber.

The Fortuneteller's Hovel~
The air is slightly hazy and carries the strong scent of musk incense which 
seems to originate from not one, but several jars specially made for the 
burning of this commodity.  Sheer gauzy curtains in gold and purple have 
been hung over the walls, candelabras of different heights positioned behind 
them.  The few candles that are lit on these metal stands cast an 
understated ambient light that makes it seem that the shadows themselves are 
alive and listening to all that occurs in this place.  Two cushions are 
placed on each side of a low round table that has been positioned in the 
middle of the floor space, made of purple velvet with golden trim.  A 
mysterious woman is seated on one of the cushions with a deck of triangular 
cards and a small glass ball that has an alcove within it for burning 
candles inside.  A beaded curtain fails to mask the door to the south.

Finkell Avenue~
Large stone buildings can be seen to the north and south, set back a ways 
from the road to allow for generous gardens in front of them and afford the 
owners some privacy.  These homes look larger than most other buildings that 
can be found in Discordia city, their size belying their imminent expense.  
The road that leads east to west here is neatly cobbled, the western side 
ending with a wrought iron gate and the eastern with a grand mansion that 
makes the other buildings on this street look feeble.

strange sense of perfection to the dwarf that runs this shop.  Shields cover 
the walls, staggered to properly display their shape and size.  Two modest 
doors can be seen within this shop--one leading to the north, the other to 
the west.

Finkell Avenue~
A cobbled road runs east to west here, the former direction stopping at the 
footpath to a large mansion while the latter is crested with a wrought-iron 
gate.  The residencies to the north and south are set back from the road a 
bit to allow for a tantalizing garden of mixed plants to help reflect the 
wealth of its occupant.  These homes appear dark and uninhabited, if one was 
to consider the lack of citizens upon this street in comparison to those 
that regularly enter the mansion at the foot of the road.

Large buildings made of carefully hewn grey stone can be seen behind 
colorful gardens to the north and south.  These gardens help to afford the 
owners some privacy, as they are no doubt rich and very well sought-after.  
Neat cobbles of light and grey stones form an almost checkerboard pattern 
from east to west here, the foot of the road ending in a considerable-sized 
mansion and the head of it protected with a wrought-iron gate.

Approaching a Grand Mansion~
Trees with gnarled bodies rise around the path that leads both east and west 
here.  Despite their ancient and rough look to them, they have recently been 
pruned and are very healthy plants.  The path is disrupted by the roots of 
these wooden guardians, which is probably what prevented the cobblestone 
from continuing to the door of the mansion.  Flowers of every color 
imaginable have been planted at random throughout this large garden, 
brightening the atmosphere with their gay petals as well as sending a gentle 
perfume into the air.

which is set a delicate looking grinder.  A few piles of keys surround the

as to the nature of this shop.  A small {csign{x has been attached to the

The pleasant smell of coffee permeats the relaxed atmosphere of this
small shop.  Several tables have been scattered around the room in what
appears to be a haphazard fashion, though the space between them is wide
enough to pass through with ease.  The floor and walls of this shop have
been made from a solid wood and stained dark brown.  The wooden tables are
stained a lighter shade of brown and have two chairs around each.  A large
counter in the back houses several sophisticated pieces of equipment, each
making a different sound and letting off a minute amount of steam.  A single
doorway to the south leads back to Market Avenue.

This cliff overlooks a large rift in the earth that stretches downwards a

current sounds soft from this distance, and the wild atmosphere has receded
to a feeling of isolation, perched atop such a pinnacle as the cliff.

Trade Your Blade~
Shelves and prongs on the walls display the finest wares of this weapons 
shop; spears, swords, daggers, axes and maces are all intermixed in a happy 
disarray, their places not seeming to be dictated by style of weapon or the 
craftmanship behind them.  Even though the items available may not have been 
made by the most famous of those in the weaponsmithing trade, each gleams 
gently in the light from careful polishing and upkeep.  A shopkeeper sits on 
a chair beside a table that has a box upon it, situated next to the door 
that leads northward.  A second door leads to the east, into Greck's armors 
shop.

Rheol's Bridge~
The swift flow of the East River makes its presence known with a steady roar 
that comes from the rapid waters coalescing over a fall of great heights to 
the north.  The bridge is wide and made of hewn stone that has been sanded 
to a nice finish.  It is named for the hero Rheol, who, as legend tells, 
build the bridge with his bare hands centuries ago.  Some thin bushes and 
scraggly trees grow over what seems to be a narrow dirt trail that leads 
below the bridge.

The countryside is pleasantly open with rolling hills and tiny farmhouses
visible in the distance.  There is a bridge to the immediate west, crossing
a swift river and leading into the town of Discordia.  To the immediate
east, you can make nothing out, it is strangely dark and fog enshrouded.  
You notice a path leading down to the river here.

The boat is small, with sufficient space for a single fishing net wielded
by two deckhands.  Although in dire need of fresh paint, the vessel is
otherwise in good condition.  The deck is well-scrubbed, and single sail is
neatly folded at the bow of the boat.  At your feet, you notice a bucket of
chum.  The seabirds seem to be eyeing it with greed, waiting for your
departure perhaps, before diving in.

side is unoccupied as yet.  Seagulls, having followed the merchant ships
inland, swoop gracefully above your head and cackle hungrily.

A Warehouse~
The warehouse entrance is littered with shards of glass and broken skids.
The wood frame building has partially rotted, through poor maintenance, and
wood dust falls upon your shoulders from above as you explore the building. 
No merchandise of any value whatsoever is in evidence here.  Crates are
stacked against the eastern wall, all of which appear to be empty through
one pile shows signs of having been moved.  At the back of the room, there
is a small card table set up, and a few chairs.  The thought strikes you
that this may be a gambling den, used by the less savory denizens of
Dockside.

A Long Pier~
A long wooden pier overlooks the wide Discordia West River.  Wooden poles
serve as handy roosts for squawking seabirds that wait for the guts and
bones of fish being filleted by fisher folk nearby.  Beyond the pier, the
calm blue water of the Discordia River flows gently southwards towards the
sea.

Down the Cliff Face~
The cliff is steep and it is difficult to get a foothold.  Firmly rooted
weeds growing out from between rocks along the cliff side offer secure hand
grips, without which you would surely fall.  Above, and just out of reach,
is the overlook of Phar Point.  Below you, waves from the rough currents of
the East Discordia River crash against the rocky shore.

Down the Cliff Face~
The rocky escarpment leads down to the river below, and up to the
southern tip of the town of Discordia, Phar Point.  Occasional deeply rooted
weeds grow out of the inhospitable rocky face, providing occasional
handholds for your traversal of the cliff.  A sheer rock face prevents
downward travel.  Your only choice is to climb upwards, or move along the
cliff laterally to the east.

Discordia Road~
Discordia Road travels east and west here, cutting through the rolling
countryside with ease.  It is well maintained by agents of the city for all
the royal traffic that comes through here.  To the north stands a field of
wheat that ripples in the wind like a green sea, and to the south there is a
flower-dotted meadow.

Before a Wreckage~
The base of the cliff is strewn with boulders tossed up from the raging
current of the East Discordia River, which meets the West river right here. 
Flotsam and jetsam bounce between the half-submerged rocks, and you come to
realize that a ship has recently succumbed to the river at this spot.

The Angry Otter~
You stand at the entrance to The Angry Otter.  A craftily carved sign
swings from above the open tavern door.  Smoke from inside wafts through the
open doorway and from within you hear loud drunken voices and guttural
laughter.  The way in is north.  The wharfs of Dockside are south.

constructed of salvaged wood, runs the length of the north wall.  The way
out is south, and there is another room to the east.

The common room has several large tables and chairs, set up as if for

to take place without interruption or spying from outside.  The walls are
tackily decorated with brass pieces of scavenged wrecks.  The sole exit is
west.

Commoner's Road~
A simple cobblestone road way runs from the east to the west here, littered 
with debris and lacking some of the stones that make up its surface.  
Standing to the north and south are simple, single story dwellings, each 
possessing a plain wooden door that appears to lack a lock.  To the west a 
crossroads is visible while to the east the road continues onwards, looking 
very much like it does here.  The smell of effluence taints the air 
slightly, most likely an indication that whatever drainage system is in 
affect has become broken.

A Simple Dwelling~
The roof of this dwelling has sagged, the cause of this is easily apparent 
when one considers that a roof beam has rotted through.  Upon the straw 
covered floor, several chipped and cracked vessels have been placed, each 
holding a small quantity of rancid water from the roof.  Against the 
northern most wall, a plain bed has been placed and covered with numerous 
mismatched blankets.  The only other thing of real note within this room is 
a small wood fueled oven which has been lovingly polished and placed against 
the western wall, close, but not dangerously so, to the bed and the doorway 
in the southern wall.

Scraps of cloth and other litter move along this east-west cobblestone 
concourse at the wind's whim.  Sometimes this detritus becomes a prisoner of 
one of the water-filled pot holes or catching on an empty barrel that sits 
at the side of the road.  Huddling against each other to the north and south 
are single story homes, their doors facing each other like mourners at a 
funeral.  The roadway continues much like it does here to the east and the 
west.

The scent of lye soap fills this small area, hinting that anything that can 
be washed with it has been.  Faded due to the care taken to clean them, a 
single set of curtains sit over the windows that flank the door in the 
southern wall, hardly preventing light from entering but certainly screening 
the meager contents of the room from the street.  A low cot fashioned from a 
rough timber frame and covered with sheets sits close to the eastern wall, 
before which a rag rug has been carefully laid.  A small table bearing a 
snub of a candle, a three legged stool and what looks to be a simple oven

and now lay broken and missing in places as they continue to serve.  The 
highway continues to the east and the west, looking very much like it does

simple wood burning stove over which a tin pile has been fixed to form a

possible in the confines of this chamber against the western wall as far

foot in one of their water-filled maws.  Slumped to either side of the road 
are dejected-looking homes, though there is little doubt that the occupants 
have done their best to keep them in good repair.  Finances appear to have 
been lacking even when the will is present.  This thoroughfare terminates in 
a solid looking wall to the east while it continues its neglected way to the 
west.

The unmistakable aroma of urine greets one's nose upon entering this hovel.  
Straw covers the floor, or at least once it was straw now it is fouled all 
but beyond recognition.  Whomever lives here must have a lack of respect for 
themselves, to say the very least, or be missing a sense of smell.  A mound 
of rags appear to make up the bed, though the term must be applied loosely 
in this instance, as no real structure seems to prevent them from spilling 
over the dirt covered floor.  Fortunately a rickety door stands in the south 
wall allowing escape from this area.

is now missing a few of the regularly sized pebbles here and there.  An 
intersection can be seen to the west, the path crossing with this one being 
flanked by plants that are both colorful and orderly.  Small huts and shacks 
seem to line the road further to the west, showing that this side of 
Discordia is not as well-to-do as the rest of town.  Rickety doors lead to 
the humble hovels that are located directly north and south of here.

A small home of modest size can be seen both to the north and south of this

and the door frame.  The pathway working between them continues to the east 
and west and was once carefully laid with cobblestones, though some of them 
seem to be missing, which helps mark this as the poorer residential area of 
Discordia city.  Weeds of all sorts grow wildly between the road and the 
small buildings, barely allowing for the paths that lead to their doors.

Smoke curls lazily from the modest housing that can be found to the north

second look, the wood has warped so badly it leaves a gap between the frame 
and the door itself.  The cobbles that cover this east to west path are 
cracked and broken in places, if not entirely missing, making the age of the 
path apparent.  Weeds grow en masse around the heavy granite stones that 
have been placed to lead to each of these homes.

this season, while the southern farm has corn that is not yet ripe.  The
fields are neatly sown even if they aren't gigantic.  Since the farm land is
open, it is easy to see that there is a bridge to a distance on the western
path, while a castle can be seen off to the east.

road known as Discordia runs through here to the east and west, kept clean
and in good repair.

Discordia Road~
The forest is dense here where it grows, hemlock, pine, and oak all doing
their utmost to turn their greenery to get the most sun, despite their
incredibly close neighbors.  A concourse leads from east to west and is
recognizable as the paved Discordia Road.  Southwards a small trail, just
large enough for a smallish wagon to fit though can be seen, judging by the
way the grass has been trampled someone must have traveled that way
recently.

Discordia Road~
Pine trees are interspersed amount the hemlocks and oak that grow to the
north and south here, the deciduous mixing with the conifers without
prejudice. Their branches lock together due to their close growth, creating
a thick canopy that shades this concourse even at midday. Discordia Road
leads the way east and west here, its paved surface scarcely damaged via
travel.

Discordia Road~
The paved way of Discordia Road continues both east and west here.  To
the east it is shrouded in darkness, and to the west it leads through some
forest.  Hemlocks, pine, and oak trees mingle together at the northern and
southern sides of the road, vying for a position directly at its side.

Hemlock, pine and oak all flank this narrow grass trail into the forest,
their ancient limbs forming a tunnel around this route.  Bird song can be
heard coming from the surrounding forest and a sound much like laughter and
talking appears to south from though this is hard to tell for sure due to
the proximate of the trees.  To the north this track meets with Discordia
Road while to the south it seems to come to a forest glade.

end of the dell a small, brightly painted {ccaravan {xcan be seen with its door
closed, before the wagon a small fire has been started and a horse tethered.
Wood smoke coils up from the fire carrying with it the scents of food which
has been cooked upon it.  A narrow trail seems to be the only exit from this
clearing, leading northward.

Apple Orchard~
Rows and rows of {Rapple{x trees have stood here for many generations. 
Each is pruned yearly in the cool season to remove the uppermost branches. 
This allows the lower branches to grow fuller and produce more of the
slightly tart fruit which is either sold at the market or turned into
delicious pies and sauce by Alma Handley.  The orchard is not large but it
is one of the best producing orchards in this part of the land.

It is the size of a Guernsey cow!  Farmer Handley has taken special care

gallon or so of the best milk.

here are very enticing.  There are doors to the west and south.  On the
brick wall to the north hang a series of cooking utensils.  On the floor is
an outline of what appears to be a door.

Storm Cellar~
This is a small storm cellar.  A wooden chest is here holding supplies
that would be useful were you stuck in the cellar during a raging
thunderstorm.  The floor is bare dirt and it is rather chilly down here.  It

This is a long dusty road leading from Discordia road to the south to the
prosperous farm owned by Brice and Alma Handley to the north.  On either
side of the road and surrounding the house are rows of poplar trees.  Their
regular spacing suggests that someone planted them there, perhaps as a
wind-break.  Through the trees to the west you see farmland where many crops
appear to be growing.

although it's easy to see that most of the resources go into the farm land
rather than keeping the house in tip-top shape.  The walls haven't had a

This is the domain of Alma Handley.  She only allows her husband, Brice,
to sit at the table to drink his morning tea before hitting the fields. 
Alma works wonders here with the fruits of their land.  A small table with
four wooden chairs sits in one corner of the cramped space.  A large brick
oven takes up another corner.  To the north, a door leads to a mud room
where she insists that all who come through leave their boots and other
muddy items.  To the east is a small open door to the pantry.  To the south
a doorway leads to the family sitting room.

table is the end in which there is a brilliant bouquet of pleasant-smelling 
flowers, artfully arranged to be eye-catching.  Though the table is not 
normally set, so that the dinnerware can be kept clean, it is obvious that 
there are regularly at least ten people in attendance for dinners here.  The 
wood of the floor is honey gold in color and are lacquered for shine and 
durability.  The walls have been painted a pale daisy yellow sort of color 
that makes this room seem unbearably happy.  Lamps bejewelled in topaz line 
the walls to provide light whenever needed.  Two modest and lacquered doors 
lead away from this chamber, one venturing south and the other west.

hearths for everything from stew to griddle cakes to roast.  The cooks seem 
very talented if the mingling smells of food and herbs would be any 
indication, the fragrances teasing one's nose as they drift on the air in 
concert.  A grand dining room can be seen to the east while a room decorated 
quite sparsely can be seen southward.

Lamps hung low on the walls gently radiate a soft glow of light.  By this 
illumination, the functionality of this room becomes apparent in its lack of 
decor and in its size.  The walls are a plain white color while the floor is 
the same lacquered wood that can be found throughout the mansion.  A door to 
the north reveals the hustle and bustle of a perpetually busy kitchen while 
a door to the south opens up to another grand chamber.  A spiral staircase

Bottom of the Staircase~
This intricate spiral staircase winds fluidly upwards, its steps a little on 
the narrow side.  However delicate the brass rail may look, years of use 
appear to have matted the carpeting that is held in place over the lacquered 
wood beneath by more brass pipes.  Brass lanterns cast forth a soft glow 
over this area from their regular intervals on the walls to give fair 
lighting, possibly curbing some of the accidents that might have involved 
these steps.  The sparseness of the furnishings here give the chamber a 
utilitarian look, signifying whomever decorated wanted function to dominate 
over fuss.  The room opens up further to the east.

A spiralling stair case, clothed in a lush but worn carpet, comes to its

area, picking out the artful floral patterns decorating the walls.  The 
floor has been left bare but heavily lacquered so that the lamplight 
reflects back upwards into the chamber, making the floor seem almost like 
water.  The hallway continues to the north and west from this landing.

trinkets, and pillows, all in all looking quite extravagant.  A soft bed of 
notable size has been set against the western wall, the canopy consisting of 
soft linen painted with hearts.  A tall mirror and dresser have been set up 
directly across from the southern entrance, each decorated with accessories 
and worldly items of refinement and class.  An archway leads away to the 
east, into another room of like size.  Some stairs crafted from wood lead 
upward from here, but they look like they are rarely utilized.

In the garret~
Dusty boxes and rickety old furniture have been half-hazardously strewn
about.  A tiny space against the northern wall has been cleared.  Dolls and
books have been carelessly dropped in the clearing.  A small window allows a

A Sun Room~
This room has wicker furniture spread around it haphazardly, almost as if 
the person who arranged them was not quite sure of what they were supposed 
to be doing.  The large window set into the northern wall is covered by a 
pale curtain that allows for this carpeted room to be bathed in either 
sunshine or moonlight, depending on the time of day.  A curtain is drawn 
closed over the eastern archway to provide the inhabitants a bit of privacy. 
Portraits of the household's members cover the walls, depicting the master 
and mistress and their lively brood of children.  The rest of the wall space 
holds tapestries of peaceful forest scenese.  One of the tapestries seems 
out of place.  Archways lead off in all directions but the north.

A Strange Chamber~
A hook set into the heavy stone wall holds a bejewelled lamp that casts a 
red glow over the generously sized chamber.  The room is spacious enough to 
afford easy walking distances between all the walls and tables herein: there 
is a rack located at the very centre of the room, bloodstained and rusting 
in spots, and several tables full of implements of intricate design are 
against the northern wall.  The southern wall sports several pairs of 
shackles in different sizes.  A fireplace has been crafted into the western 
wall to allow additional lighting into the room, beside which are a stoker 
and a branding iron.

unknown.

Dockside South~
Dockside South continues to follow the course of the West Discordia
River.  The docks are busy with merchant mariners, warfare vessels and the
sailors that man them.  Along the river side, large piers have been built to
dock the largest ships that come up river.  Along land side, there are
commercial buildings, warehouses and taverns of all kinds.  Dockside South
continues south and west.

most southerly stretch of land in the town of Discordia.  At rocky Phar
Point, the rough East Discordian waters meet the smooth West waters.  On

towards the sea.  From the heights of Phar Point, you watch the seemingly
tiny merchant ships, fishing boats and graceful pleasure craft move silently
across the river.  To the east, a beautiful waterfall marks the angry
arrival of the East Discordia River and westwards, the quiet, peaceful
waters of the West Discordia become one with the Great River.

Discordia.  Merchant ships and fishing vessels find berth here after the
long trip up the Great Discordia River from the Sea.  It is an area of
business and bustle for the merchants and fishermen, but is often dangerous
to the uninitiated newcomer.  Dockers Road and Discordia Road can be seen to
the east and south respectively, and the River Boardwalk is west.  Dockside
West continues to the north.

they reek of fish guts and gull guano.  To your east you can see the Arch

water and brushing lightly on the pier.  A flock of seagulls noisily scoop
and dive through the air near by, seemingly laughing at the sight of fresh
fish.  A large warehouse is to your east, and the end of the pier over to
your west.  A wooden ladder leads from the end of the pier to the river

Large candelabras stand in each of the four corners of this chamber, each
holding several candles a piece with there wax running in rivers down the
candles' flanks.  These candelabras provide a subdued illumination to this
place, bright enough to see by but leaving much in soft shadow and, in some
places, gloom.  Long, hard wood benches have been pushed against each of the
walls, providing ample room for patrons of the Healers Altar to rest. 
Before these benches, a few plush chairs and large pillows have been placed
around a low round table in the center of the floor where a young female
tervadi that provides food customarily rests.  A gauzy curtain leads
eastward into Celeteste's healing chamber, where rows and rows of pews can
be seen, as well as a fountain and the altar that gives this establishment
its name.

on your hands and knees, the ceiling scratches your back in places and the 
sides are never far from your elbows.  The tunnel goes on quite a ways, 
easily more than thirty feet, or perhaps it is even longer.  The walls, 
ceiling, and floor are a rough stone, seeming to be granite, which does a 
marvelous job of removing the skin from your palms and knees.  The tunnel

The Twin Fountains~
In this room there are two fountains, with wide bases indended for resting 
upon.  The left fountain is made of obsidian, and pure, cool water flows 
from its top.  The right fountain is made of a pure white stone, and an 
oddly thick, red liquid flows up from the basin into a wide bowl at the 
top.   The floor is tiled in blue marble, although this is almost entirely 
covered with rugs of roughed silk with varying repetitive patterns.  It 
seems safe to assume that the walls here are made of the same stuff as 
elsewhere, although this is impossible to determine due to the plethora of 
fine silken sheets, velvet curtains, and gilded tapestries which adorn the 
walls.  From the ceiling hang several oil lamps on chains, providing a 
pleasing glow to the room.  There are exits in all four directions.

An Odd Forge~
There is a forge here, with the standard tools that accompany forges, as 
well as the usual three buckets of liquid: distilled water, salt water, and 
fine Taj-Al-Jahizian olive oil.  Leaning against the wall are squared bars 
of steel, mithril, copper, brass, and a few other metals.  To the side of 
these are several portable crucibles, the bottoms of which are {ydis{rco{blo{yre{rd{x, 
possibly from the application of extreme heat.  To the back of the room is 
an oddly small furnace, in which a {bbl{Bu{We f{Bla{bme{x burns.  Waves of heat come 
from this area, nearly causing you to choke.  An odd humming fills the air, 
causing you to grind your teeth without really knowing why.  The floor and 
walls here are the same as elsewhere in the compound, but the ceiling has 
been discolored from soot.

Fenring's Abode~
This is your home, Fenring, Old Man of the Mountain, and it feels like it.  
The savage opulence that permeates the rest of the guild is not to be found 
here.  Rather, there is a relaxed feel here, as in a coffee house or opium 
den.  A lone mattress is here, with a single pillow and blanket.  An 
overstuffed, roughed-silk armchair is set before a heavy wooden desk.  A 
bookshelf rests against the wall to the right of where the door should be, 
while the wall on the left is almost entirely covered with single piece of 
{Kmir{cro{Kred {cglas{Ks{x.  Despite the room's blatant precautions, holes must have 
been drilled for air, for the candles and single lamp that burn on the desk 
and elsewhere do not look starved for oxygen.  A stream of water pours down 
one corner, away from the mirror, and seems relatively clean.

A Corn Field~
Swaying like exotic dancers, the countless ears of corn, move upon their
stems to the wind's whim.  To the south and east, more fields filled with
more green corn waiting to ripen can be seen clearly, while to the north
there is a paved road visible.  Breaking the monotony of the still-ripening
corn are the heads of the occasional wildflower, their bright blue making a
welcome change to the eye.  From the hidden depths of the corn, the faint
sounds of tiny creatures can be heard.

A Corn Field~
Long ears of green corn stand tall and proud from the packed earth of
this field each swaying its head to the winds command, like soldiers in a
well trained army.  The green sea of corn stems is occasionally broken by a
vibrant purple or blue wildflower poking its head up towards the sky.  To
the east a packed earthen road is visible winding its way between more
fields filled with crops while over the top of the corn, a distant farm
house can be seen to the north over a paved road.  A meadow can be seen over
some manicured shrubs to the east.

A Corn Field~
Corn stalks heavy with seed grow here waiting upon the sun's magic to
ripen them.  This sea of swaying green is broken in places by bright
wildflowers of yellow and red, their petal faces seeking the sky.  To the
south a high hedge stands between this field and slope, while a small dry
stone wall separates this field from the cliff overlooking the East river. 
North and east, the corn field stretches away.

A Corn Field~
Innumerable ears of green corn grow here, waiting for the sun to ripen
them to a golden color, the heads already heavy with seeds.  From deep
within these plants, the sounds of small animals can be heard living out
their lives in secret from mortal eyes.  To the east is a farm house while
to the south there is a red two story barn.

A Cabbage Field~
Planted in furrows are countless cabbages waiting to ripen and be
harvested.  Weeds flourish between these, growing much taller than the
desired crop.  The odd bright wildflower can be seen growing, mixed in with
these.  Occasionally, movement can be discerned within the field as a small
grey-brown rabbit is briefly spotted hopping its way between cabbages.  To
the north and east more cabbages can be seen, littering the earth as they,
too, wait for harvest time.  To the south there is a paved roadway.

A Cabbage Field~
Small green cabbages litter the earth here, clearly planted by the hand
of man, going by their regular spacing and the fact they are in rows.  Now
and then the ears of a rabbit can be seen poking up as it attempts to keep
lookout while stealing its dinner.  Westward and northward hold similar
fields, hemmed in at the south by a paved road.  To the east, a hedge
separates this field from a wheat field.

hopping gate between these plants, disappearing from time to time within the
field.  To the west and south, more cabbage fields spread out just like this

Outside A Barn~
The long, lush grasses of this meadow come to a stop outside a large red
clay brick building to the east.  The earth before it has been trampled to
hard, packed mud by the passage of numerous feet, leading to a set of twin
doors that are easily twice the height of a large man.  Set into the second
story of this construction is what must be the hay loft, going by the winch
rigged over it and the wide opening door fashioned there.  To the north
there is a corn field, still green, that stretches off into the distance.

At A Sty Wall~
A long, low, brick building has been placed here.  Standing no more than
six feet at the apex of its slanting roof, this building seems to have been
more designed for its intended occupants than for human comfort.  Over the
fence to the north, the corn fields stretch away, while to the east is what
appears to be a barn.  An odor of manure can be distinctly detected from
this construction.  You can enter the sty to the south.

This two-story house looks out over the open farm land before it to the
west.  A single door with a much worn boot scraper faces the corn fields. 
Fashioned out of irregular hand crafted red clay bricks, this building has
clearly been made to last.  Surrounding the door way is an arch decked with
flowering small pink rose bushes, some of them in full bloom and others
still budding.  Four shuttered windows can be seen, two on the ground floor
and two on the upper floor.

A short hallway stretches north to east here, ending in oaken doors in
both directions.  Off to the north and south stand simple pine doors,
painted cream to compliment the white-washed walls.  Multicolored rag rugs
sit just inside of the doorways so that mud and dirt are not traveled too
far into the building from the outside world.  To the south, a faint odor of
baking bread can be detected.  Running parralel to the hall stand a set of
stairs running to an upstairs landing.

A Cottage Kitchen~
Red stone tiles cover the floor of this room, giving a warm feeling that
is backed up by the large cast-iron range standing against the western wall.
A small wooden table stands on the northern side of this range, upon which
have been placed several pots and pans, while on the southern side is a
large pot sink.  In the center of the room is a large pine table with chairs
neatly stored under it, big enough to seat at least four with ease.  A
window facing south, to catch the noon sun, is flanked by a pair of
sun-bleached red curtains.  The only apparent exits from this room are a
hatch in the floor and a door in the north-most wall.  The odor of baked
bread fills this room, wafting from the stove.

Various crates have been stacked about this area for storage, while into
some of the beams strong looking hooks have been sunk, in order to support
sacks, should they be needed.  A ladder against the north-most wall

the fire place while a wooden rocking chair has been arranged under the
window to the north.  Flower patterned curtains sit either side of the
window upon a wooden rail for ease if they are desired closed.  To the
northern edge of the hearth a fire poker and tongs sit upon a carved log.  A
simple wooden door has been set into the west wall painted a pale cream to
compliment the white washed walls.  A door leads to the south.

The floorboards that have been joined together to comprise the floor are
old and worn, lacking any luster or shine despite their cleanliness.  No
decoration is evident in this hall, leaving it looking quite plain.  The
walls have been freshly white-washed and a pair of pine doors have been set
into them to the east and west.  At the southern end of the hallway, a
sturdy-looking ladder stands, leading to a hatch in the ceiling.  A narrow
staircase leads down to the floor below from this landing.

Geoff's Explorations~
The musty odor of old parchment permeates the air of this quaint little
shop. Several silver sconces hang upon the walls, casting an eerie light
across the finely tiled and well maintained floors. Tacked upon the walls
are several maps, both ancient and new, displaying various regions of
Discordia. Near the back wall, a large glass case can be seen displaying 
various rolled parchments and navigational tools. Upon the case is a well
worn wooden counter top.

glow with a vibrant aura in the bright lighting from the magical orbs that 
float overhead.  An order desk is at the center of the floor, unnaturally 
large in size and bearing strange designs in all respects and seems to be 
made for a giant of sorts.  Two chairs constructed entirely of sapphire are 
open north the side of the desk that is nearest to the doorway that leads

This place is a pig sty, literally.  The smell of decomposing excrement
fills the air both with its pungent odor and warmth.  The earth floor long
ago turned to muck which now looks like it would throw almost any one over
if they dared to try and walk across it.  Pens have been created from the
walls jutting into the room that are closable, if needed, though all at this
time have been left open.  In the backs of these pens wooden troughs sit,
waiting to be filled with food or water.  A low doorway to the north leads
outside, into what would appear to be a farm yard.

This double story building has been divided into the hay loft above and
stalls for animals upon this level, as well as storage.  Sacks of animal
feed hang down from hooks set into the rafters of the hay loft in an attempt
to keep them from rats.  A plough sits in the corner, waiting for the repair
of its blades.  The walls are made of whitewashed brick which has become
stained around the base by the passage of beasts.  A ladder leads up to the
hay loft above while a single door set into the northeastern corner and a
double set of doors to the west presumably lead to the outside world.

A Wheat Field~
Rows and rows of meticulously sowed crops spring forth from the dark
soil, growing tall and swaying in most breezes.  The green stalks bear
numerous small husks on them and the field appears to be dominated by
wheat-bearing plants.  Through a row of green stalks to the south, a large
meadow can be seen with green grass that is only broken by patches of brown,
and, in some cases, colorful bursts of flowers, across a well-kempt road. 
The wheat stretches on to the north and east, the planted field only
stopping for a restrictive hedge that separates it westward from another
crop.  The field ends to the east by the castle's gates.

some wildflower in red or purple.  Every so often, some corn or wheat breaks
the contiguous plain, most likely scattered here by the passage of some
careless creature.  To the west, some trimmed shrubs prevents progress into
a field of corn, while wheat seems to grow in abundance to the north,
eastwards the meadow stretches onwards.  Crickets can be heard chirping
steadily from all around.

blossoms bloom about this field giving a gay splash of color to what would
otherwise be a grass and brown field.  A road runs parallel with the field
to the north, over which ornate gates can be seen.  Forest looms to the
east, its wild growth blocking passage in that direction.

you.  Looking down the path you see raised flower beds on either side.  At

Northwards stand the gilded gates of the temple grounds, cutting off this

Garden Crossroads~
This is a cross-roads of sorts in the paths of the city gardens.  To the
north you can see a long path lined with great stone planters filled with
blooming flowers in every color of the rainbow.  To the south is the great
stone temple of Discordia.  East and west run another path which is also
lined with flowers, although these aren't in raised beds.

Before the Grand Temple~
You are standing before an impressive stone temple.  The door leading
into the temple is a large, open arch.  Bourganvilla vines grow on either
side of the arch meeting at the top in the center in a brilliant orchestra
of colorful flowers.  The arch leads into a great dome which towers over all
other structures in the town.  To the north of you are expansive gardens
which the inhabitants of Discordia are free to enjoy.

Temple Entrance~
You are just inside the entrance of the great Temple of Discordia.  Along
the entrance wall are rows of wooden cubby holes where those who come to
worship leave their footwear.  Looking out to the north you see the
beautiful gardens that are tended to by the monks of the temple.  To the
south you see into the dome of the temple.  A circle of fire separates the
living altar from the rest of the room.  Many who have come to worship are
kneeling near the altar.

Cavernous Temple~
This is the cavernous temple of Discordia.  The huge dome is impressive
both by it's size and it's beauty.  The curved ceiling has the lustrous
appearance of mother-of-pearl.  Near the center of the room is a large
altar.  Vines, which grow from large pots at the base, cling to the sides of
the altar making the entire structure appear to be alive.  Around the altar
is a ring of candles, kept burning at all times creating a ring of fire. 
Only those who are worthy to receive training are allowed inside the ring. 
To the west is the silver Hall of Heroes.  The golden Hall of Gods lies to
the east.  To the south is the dark Hall of the Ancients.  A chill comes
from that direction.

This is a long hallway with walls that are made of gold.  A mural of a
tremendous battle has been imprinted on the walls here.  It is a depiction
of the War of the Ancients for control of Discordia in which the Ancients
were destroyed.  Many lesser gods and a few greater gods perished along with
heroes and scores of common folk.  This hallway leads to the Shrine of Fallen
Gods.

Hall of the Ancients~
This is a long, dark hallway.  The walls are made of a hard, shiny black
material.  It is very cold and you feel a terrible presence.  It is as if
the walls radiate evil and suck away all that is good.  It seems an odd
thing for an otherwise peaceful temple.  This is the Hall of the Ancients. 
It's purpose is to remind the populace of Discordia of the misery that was
under the Reign of the Ancients.

Hall of the Ancients~
The end of the Hall of the Ancients is cold and eerie.  Below you is the
Shrine of the Ancients from which evil radiates.  Discordia should never
forget the sheer power and strength that was possessed by the Ancient Ones. 
Most of them were greater in magical powers than all of the known races. 
Some were even more powerful than the gods.  Many heroes were killed and
even Gods were destroyed in the battle to rid Discordia of their evil
presence.

Shrine of Heroes~
This is the Shrine of Heroes.  Everything, the walls, the statues and the 
floor are made of polished silver.  The great heroes who perished in the war 
with the Ancients are remembered here.  Their deeds have been told and 
retold around countless hearths.  In the center of the room is a statue of 
the great dwarven warrior Xanator.  A likeness of Mochin, the legendary 
elven mage, who is fabled to have fallen the first of the Ancients, stands 
next to that of Corin, the human cleric who's healing talents were so 
helpful in the final battle.  Too many heroes fell in the war for each to 
have their own statue.  Two hands raising from the ground, one holding an 
ornate sword and the other a fireball, are the symbol of the great deeds 
done by the many unsung heroes.  Northwards a masterly crafted archway can 
be seen in which a pair of double doors stand.

bring havoc.  Few are brave enough to come here to witness the shrine for

bowed as you past by them.  Several large fountains bubble peacefully here. 
They are connected with an elaborate system of aqueducts.  A few flower

provides a great deal of illumination.  The candles are of varying heights
and widths, and the hot wax drips down them slowly.  There are some large
plush pillows covering the floor in the center of the room.  In the center
of the pillows is a glowing floating figure.  Celeteste, the city cleric
smiles calmly as you walk down the aisle.  You notice a lot of people in the
room, sitting waiting to be cured by the cleric.  There is a small fountain
off to the north end of the room.  Toward the back of the room there is a

Wild Weapons~
"Wild Weapons" is a surprisingly conservative place.  On the walls many
types of swords and axes are displayed while some of the more exotic items
of destruction are kept inside a glass cabinet.  There is very little in
this store that seems to promote excitement - everything is neatly ordered
and labeled and quite boring.  The door to the south is possibly the most
"wild" thing about the place.

The Tired Traveller~
This shop is plain, functional, and relaxing to the traveller who spends much
time exploring strange and terrifying lands.  There's a soft chair to sink
into as you haggle with the shopkeeper for your goods.  The shelves, built
solidly into the hard wood walls, are stacked orderly with all the various
odds and ends that the traveller might need.  Although the journey is long, it
is places like this that make it possible, and provide a brief respite.

Market Avenue~
Looking around, you note that Market Avenue seems to have actually been
designed rather than allowed to grow like most of the other streets in the
village.  Every shop front has the same large mahogany doors and the same
marble exterior.  The smell of baking bread draws your attention to the
bakery to the north.  Gazing around some more you can see what appears to be
a fruit shop to the south.  Market Avenue continues to the east and west.

Fabulous Fruits~
"Fabulous Fruits" is a fairly small shop.  The whole place smells like an
orchard and colourful fruits are stacked everywhere you can see.  Boxes upon
boxes of apples, bananas, pears, peaches, limes and apricots line the walls.
A rough wooden counter is used to conduct trade and standing behind this
counter is the shops owner.

The walls of the Pastry Post have been painted a warm brown colour and
decorated with a few well placed bushels of wheat.  One of the first things
you notice is the smell of baking bread - the baker is known to keep her
ovens going night and day to keep up with demand.  The large glass counter
is the focal point of the shop and peering inside you spot all manner of
tempting delicacies.  Stacked around you on roughly built wooden shelves are
dozens upon dozens of loaves of bread, cakes and pastries.

Magical Delights~
The faint smell of spice along with the pungent odor of {Ysulphur{x permeates
the air of this mystical shop. The floor is covered by a well padded, {Kblack{x
carpet with mystic symbols woven upon its surface. The walls are finely
covered in dark {Mpurple{x velvet embroidered with faintly glowing runes of
protection, providing both a sense of majesty and security. Upon these
walls, several pewter shelves containing various jars of spices and bottles
of foreign fluids can be seen. Behind the haze of incense smoke, a large
glass counter and viewing case can be seen near the far wall. Small globes
of magical light float over the counter, illuminating both it and the wares
hanging on the back wall. An eerie feeling passes over you, almost as if
something unseen is watching your every move.
