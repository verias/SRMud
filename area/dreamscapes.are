note~
I Azahael the great archmage have taken up residence just outside the
entrance to the dream realm. I have created this humble abode in the astral
plane and then linked it to the dreamscape. It has proven to be a safe
haven from both the dangers and wonders within. I humbly apologize for
the rudeness of my invisible stalker. He is here to prevent those lacking
in might from entering the keep of dreams.
   I began searching for the plane of dreams long ago. It has been my
life's study as both an archmage and sage, to uncover and write about its
secrets. I beseech you to not tread from the main path on the way to the
keep. Many horrible dangerous abound! Use the key contained within this
drawer to gain entrance to the keep. For without it, you may not join me
within.
   I realize you are wondering how you came to arrive to this plane. Let me
explain. I recently made a pact with the mighty Dream Lord in return for
my services. He agreed to randomly pull adventurers who are strong enough
to survive into this realm, so that they may explore and report on its
wonders. He has even extended his invitation to those of exceptional might.
Those that can best my mighty guardian are allowed to tour Dream Keep.
Since you are currently reading this:  This means you!!!
   I again give my sincerest apology for any trouble that this may have
caused you. I look foward to seeing you in the keep!
 
your friend,
 
Azahael

CHAPTER 3 - The Great Conflict

Shortly after forming the new entities and lords in the Dreamscape, the
Lord of Dreams received a vision. This vision foretold of an upcoming war
that would ravage everything and sunder worlds. The vision was so shaking
and realistic that he began the construction of what today is known as the
keep of dreams, or Dream Keep more commonly. This great fortress was built
to withstand tremendous forces and to be a bastion of hope against the
tidings of war.
   As the completion of the keep drew near, the Lord was yet again overcome
by a startling vision. It fortold again of impending doom, but this time,
in the near future. Two weeks later, the battle with the Ancient Ones began.
All the races along with their Gods revolted against the tyranny and slavery
of the Ancients.
   It is hard to imagine, in today's reality, the sure power and strength of
number the Ancient Ones posessed. Most of them were greater in magical powers
than all the races, and some were even more powerful than the gods. War raged
across the earth and the heavens, shattering the ground and the sky. Many
refugees fled the fighting, holding up in various safe havens around the
realm. Many heroes died and armies were crushed under the onslaught of the
Ancient Ones, even Gods were destroyed. Things were looking very grim for
the enemies of the Ancients and their gods.
   Fearing total destruction of mankind and the other races, the Lord of
Dreams opened his plane to the flood of refugees and to the tattered remains
of the human armies and their gods. After locating and taking in all the
remanents of the resitance, the Lord closed the gates to his realm, buying
some time from the Ancients' onslaught.
   The combined efforts of the Lord and the gods to build up the defenses
of Dream Keep were worthwhile. When the Ancients burst open the gates and
flooded the Dreamscape, they were met with stiff resistance. Many human
generations were born and later died as the battle raged on for an eternity.
Not once was the keep proper breached by the forces of the Ancients. They
could not break the strength of the keep nor the spirits of it's defenders,
nor could the defenders gain any ground towards defeating them.
   During one particularly fearsome battle, the Lord of Dreams called a
council of his rulers. He beseeched upon the Lord of Nightmares to use
his powers to divine the fears of the ancients. He then ordered the Lord
of good dreams to use his powers to give the Ancients their most craved
desire, that of the destruction of all mankind. The whispered the last portion
of his brilliant plan to the last of his lords.
   Outside, on the plains of dreaming, the Ancients saw the keep's defenses
begin to fail. Smelling victory, they massed their forces for a final assault
to end the resistance once and for all. They charged the Keep, smashing
through defenses and defenders alike, destroying all in their path. Then
the trap was sprung, horrible images assaulted the Ancients relentlessly.
They were being attacked by nightmares in the form of their most terrifying
fears. One by one, the ancients were driven mad and began to beg and plead
for release from their torment. The Lord of Oblivion was happy to deliver
their request. As the Ancients began to drop on the field of battle into
oblivion, the defenders rushed from the keep and began their slaughter. Thus
ended the reign of the Ancients.

CHAPTER 2 - The Creation
 
   When man and the other races were created, a strange occurance was noted
by the Great Creator. These races were weaker in both physical and mental
strength in comparison to the Ancient Ones. To alleviate this weakness and
to allow them to rejuvenate, the Creator established a state of being known
as sleep. This restful state would immensly help its creations, and an
immediate increase in cognitive and physical strength was noted. To
accomodate this state, the quasi plane of sleep was created inorder to hold
their minds. This would prevent their minds from becoming lost in the void
while in this state.
   While in the plane of sleep, it was found that their minds were restless.
Some of them would become so restless that their mind would turn in on
themselves and escape prematurely from the realm of sleep. To keep the
minds pacified, the Great Creator established the Dreamscape to catch 
restless minds and keep them entertained until they left the realm of sleep.
The Lord of Dreams was then created to keep a watchful eye over the
Dreamscape.
   The Ancient Ones, not needing to sleep themselves, were jealous of this
wonderous creation. In the dark, out of the view of the Great Creator, they
plotted against the Dream Lord. When the Creator slipped into its eternal
sleep, they began to bring their plots into fruition.
   One of the most powerful Ancient Ones, who's name I dare not repeat, 
arranged a meeting with the Lord of Dreams. During this meeting, the Lord
was tricked into creating the nightmares to haunt the dreams of the wicked.
Later, the Lord realized his mistake, for not only did the nightmares stalk
the dreams of the wicked, they stalked the dreams of the benign. Agahst, the
Lord of Dreams quickly attempted to remedy the situation, creating both the
sweet dreams and their lord to counteract the nightmares. Wanting to avoid
conflict within his realm, the Lord created and regulated the dreams'
activites. Thus, what is now know as the dream cycle was created. In this
process he created a third entity to control the minds' activites between
various dream states, thus the Lord of Oblivion came into existence.

CHAPTER 1 - The Early History
 
   At the beginning of time, existence was a vast, empty void. Out of the 
darkness, a vastly powerful being emerged. This being quickly grew bored
with the emptiness surrounding it and begin to forge the stars and the sky
out of the nothing. The Creator was amused by the twinkling lights and the
complexities of its creation for only a short time, however. To relieve its
ever growing boredom, the Creator decided to forge the worlds, instilling
them with skies, land, and oceans. To further increase its chances of
amusement, the Creator then decided to make life. Beasts, both large and
small soon began to team within its creation. Thus was the beginning of
life.
   Eons passed while the Creator watched and examined its wonderous creation.
New creatures were made as other died out, an eternal cycle of life and death.
One day in the passing eon a small life form captured the Creators attention.
This life form, although average size and very ungainly in appearance seemed
to possess intellegence. It moved with the careful precision of thought and
was even able to use its environment to hunt and protect itself. Over time,
great cities were formed by the creatures and many wars were fought. These
creatures, the Ancient Ones as we now call them, began to flourish in the
Creators realm. 
   Man and the other intelligent races were soon to follow. Seeing this
wonderous creation spring up on its own, the Creator decided to mimic it with
similiar creations of its own. Thus humans, elves, dwarves and the other
sentient races were created. To guide and rule these creatures, the gods
were created and cast out into the heavens to watch over the world. Seeing
that its creations were well cared for, the Great Creator left the realm
and slipped into an eternal sleep, leaving its creations to themselves.

CHAPTER 4 - New Beginnings
 
   The races and their Gods emerged from the Dreamscape to find their home
in utter chaos and discord. The old geography had completely changed. New
oceans and mountain ranges sprung up from areas that used to be desert and
plains and the reverse was true as well. Wary, the races forged treaties with
one another to work in unison to rebuild their homes and to explore their
land. This period lasted for a hundred years and was know as the Age of Light.
   Eventually, the races that were natural born enemies, began to fall into
their normal habits of hatred and bloodshed. Dwarves began fighting giants,
while the elves began to battle the orcs. These acts of violence eventually
involved all the races, once again throwing the realm into chaos. Eventually
the fighting did stop and the races moved on to their own things, each living
as was intended. Over the eons battles were won and lost, but never again
was the realm shattered by major calamity. This hard and dangerous land
came to be known as the Realm of Discordia.

A touch of home~
Various shades of green and a myriad of other colors fill this small
glen.  Many different species of birds can be heard fluttering around the
branches of a majestic oak tree, singing their sweet songs.  A large, rather
out of place fissure can be seen running throught the trunk of the tree.  As
you view the area, a light breeze begins to blow, gently rustling through
the branches.  Caught up in the gentle breeze, small, white dandelion
flowers break from their stems and float gently into the fresh, crisp air. 
A small wooden sign is nailed to the tree. It is completely free of wear and
its paint looks freshly done. A strange, swirling vortex appears in the air.

Deep sleep.~
Dreary eyed, you fight the encroaching slumber. It seems as if the
sandmen have finally gotten to you. Each step is a struggle, it feels
as if your legs are lead weights, barely responding to your commands.
Your labored breathing begins to calm, quickly transforming into a
slow, smooth rhythm. The hazy features of your surroundings begin to
dim, and then fade away all together. The ground seems to move towards
you, then all is black. When you "awaken", you see a faintly glowing
portal before you. It appears to hum with an inward energy and 
pulsate in a smooth rhythm. You stare in wonder at the portal when
a realization hits you with astounding force, it seems as though the
portal is pulsating in tune with your heart!

Dreamscape~
A seemingly endless plain stretches out beyond the horizon, its features
a chaotic mix of both wonders and horrors. Various scrub brushes and
beautiful flowers intermixed with twisted forms of vegetation litter
the landscape for as far as the eye can see. Off in the distance, twisted
forms can be seen moving across the plain in various directions. Far off,
a shimmering structure can be seen. From appearance it seems to be some
sort of a castle or keep with a very surreal quality. Small shapes can
be seen moving across the battlements on the outer curtain wall, and from
this vantage point, what seems to be large seige engines, rest atop the
various towers and bastions.

The changing path~
The huge structure looms on the horizon. It is much easier now, to make
out the figures on the battlements. Although their exact race cannot be
seen, they seem vaguely humanoid in shape and size. The outer curtain
wall seems to stretch to the north and south for as far as the eye can see.
Every hundered meters or so, a tower or bastion juts from the wall. Armored
forms can be seen manning the various catapults and ballistae. Although
there is a look of readiness about the entire structure, it does not seem
menacing in any way. A smooth cobblestone path begins here and runs to
the center of the shimmering structure. Cobblestone? On closer examination
it appears as if the path is made brick, you could have sworn it was
cobblestone. Then, right before your very eyes, the path becomes hazy and
seems to fade away, then disappear all together. It has been replaced by
a narrow winding path, paved in gold.

Wandering the dreamscape~
An open plain stretches out to the horizon. Far off to the south, a gigantic
structure can be seen, its outer wall extending out seemingly forever.
Many forms of plant and animal life inhabit this twisted plain, the stuff
of both dreams and nightmares. The sky is both cloudless and bland, creating
a very surreal picture. No breeze can be felt, yet the twisted plant life
seems to sway to and fro as if a gentle breeze were blowing.

a gigantic structure can be seen, its outer wall extending out beyond

animal life inhabit this endless plane. Creatures of vast beauty and weal
can be seen interacting with creature both foul and horrendous. Although
everything is tangible and seemingly "real", the visions before you, at
times, almost seem like apparitions. It is almost as if they fade in and out
of existence. No breeze can be felt, yet strangely, the plant life seems
to sway in tune with a ghostly breeze.

The seemingly endless plain is broken by a large feature to the northeast.
A large mountain has appeared on the horizon, seemingly out of thin air.
It is still quite a distance away, however, light can be seen reflecting
off its snow covered peaks. This looming giant grows nearer on the horizon
at such a rapid pace, it seems as if it will over take and crush this
exact spot. After a few short seconds, the approaching mountain slows its
approach before coming to a final stop. It cannot be determined if this

mountain is a sentient creature or just another oddity of this twisted
land.

Natural dreams~
Beautiful, soft music is flowing from nearby, filling the air with its
sweet harmony. Although the exact source of it is undetermined, it is
obvious that the musician is one of rare talent. A cool breeze can be felt,
gently blowing in from the north, and for the first time since being on
the dreamscape, the features of the sky can be seen. The chaotic
landscape has transformed itself here into a small clearing within a
beautiful copse of majestic oaks. The sweet sounds of song birds can be heard
coming from the branches above. That along with the abundance of other
forest life, gives this area a very abundant sense of serenity. It appears
as if all in nature is in perfect harmony.

The features of the dreamscape slowly fade away and are replaced with a

Several voluptuous woman wander around, naked from the waist up. Others

this seems to be some sort of play room for a large harem.

The changing path continues to shift in size, shape and texture as it
winds towards Dream Keep. From this vantage point, there is a clear view
of the massive structure. A gigantic gate, dwarfed by two even larger
towers, can be seen at the end of the path. Humanoid forms in shining
armor can be seen milling about on the battlements of both the curtain
wall and the massive towers. Numerous seige engines such as catapults
and ballistae are neatly tucked away in strategic positions, all sites
aimed out over the dreamscape. Although there is no perceived sense of
urgency, the ever vigilant guards maintain a watchful eye over the

The winding trail~
A narrow, rocky trail begins its steep climb up the mountain here. Rocks
and boulders litter the winding trail, making any attempt of a climb
quite dangerous. As the trail winds its way higher into the mountain,
steep cliffs can be seen to its side. A faint sound, almost like a
terrified shriek, can be heard in the distance.

The steep climb~
The smooth rocky face and small pebbles make traveling quite difficult
over this nearly verticle climb. Luckily there is an occasional scrub to
use as a handhold, making the passage only slightly less difficult. Again
the screaming begins. It sounds quite feminine, but with the sheer sound
of terror in the scream, it is quite difficult to be positive. Also,
very faintly in the distance, a loud ominous rumbling can be heard.

The narrow ledge~
The steep climb up the winding trail ends on a narrow ledge. Looking out
over the ledge, the twisted features of the dreamscape can be made out
far below. At the very edge of the horizon, Dream Keep can be seen. A
loud piercing scream comes from above. Its seems a young woman who was
climbing the cliff face has slipped and is hanging onto a small rock
pecariously with one hand. As you watch, her desperate situation turns
into tragedy as her grip loosens and she plummets high from the cliff
above. Her scream of terror gets insanely loud as she plummets by you,
then fades away after she rushes by, narrowly avoiding this ledge. Before
there is any chance to react, another loud scream comes from above.
Somehow, the woman is back on the cliff, again hanging from a rock. Then
in repetition, the same macabre cycle begins again.

The distant rumbling gets louder as you continue on the mountain path. It
feels as if the very mountain itself is vibrating under the force. A sheer
cliff drops of before you, and you find yourself overlooking a raging river.
Large chunks of ice bob up and down in the raging torrent as it flows down
the mountain at a breathtaking pace. A small footpath around the cliff leads
down into the river.

Luckily you managed to find a calm spot near a large rock before you
are swept away in what would be a sure death. The sound of the water is
deafening, yet somehow you manage to make out a garbled scream. A wet
and slightly blue form is splashing about upstream. You can make out
what seems to be female features beaneath strands of tangled hair. The
woman seems to be in great distress and is on the verge of drowning. Before
you can attempt to rescue her, she slips beneath the raging torrent, never
to resurface again. Just then, another garbled scream captures your 
attention. Its seems the malicious drowning scene is replaying itself
again.

The precarious cliff~
This steep climb is extremely precarious. You find yourself struggling from
rock to rock, nearly falling a dozen times. Currents of noticably cooler air
blow in on a stiff breeze, making the climb even more dangerous. Far down
below, you see a raging river streaming down the mountain, probably the result
of a large snow melt. A faint rumble can be heard from high above you where
the beginning of the snow cap can be seen.

Past the snow cap~
With the beginning of the snow cap behind you, you find yourself on a frozen
waste. The bitter cold of the wind whips around, blinding you in swirling
snow. The frozen ground and sheer strength of the wind, makes all movement
here difficult. Continuing upwards towards the peak is impossible due to
the extreme incline and the ice. You feel a slight tremor beneath you, shortly
followed by a deafening rumble. Suddenly tons of ice and snow began to slide
down from the peak above, heading directly towards you. The only possible
escape is to either seek shelter below or to hurry east along the waste.

large oaken table presides in the center of the room, basking in the dim
candlelight from sconces on the wall. A large ham sits in the the center
of the table on a silver platter, glistening in what appears to be some
sort of honey glaze. Various fruits are intermingled with breads and
cheeses all about the table. A large decanter of wine can be seen on the

landscape. The sky is grey and overcast and the ground is barren and 
perfectly flat. Pure evil permeates the air from all around, and it seems
as if some horrific presence is out there, wait and watching for new prey.
The air rapidly begins to decline in temperature and you can see the frosty
mist of your breath in the air. Very near you, from behind, a loud thump
echoes across the barren landscape. The sound of falling footsteps can
be heard and felt coming from the same direction. Whatever it is, it
appears to be quite large due to the small tremors in the ground as it 
makes its way towards you. The evil permeating the air grows stronger,
almost to the point of being suffocating.

begins to fade, until it too is engulfed in darkness. You blindly stumble
around in the overwhelming darkness looking for some feature to use as
a landmark, but you find nothing. After a few minutes of stumbling, you
notice a small, twinkling light in the distance, rocketing towards you like
a shooting star. The light grows larger as it approaches and you notice
that it seems to be some sort of window or portal about twice the size and
length of a large doorway. It slows down as it approaches, and comes to a full
stop in front of you. Looking at the portal, you notice a vaguely familiar
place on the otherside. Somewhere in the real world perhaps?

on the dimensions of the oak tree. This quaint little room is illuminated
by glowing spheres of light, encapsulated within crystal globes that are
hung on the wood grain walls. A large window is set within one wall, from
which the area outside of the tree can be viewed. In fact, the very top of the 
snoozing dwarf's head can be seen, propped against the lower left corner
of the glass. Facing the window is a large desk. Various papers and
scrolls are scattered about on its surface. Adorning the walls are book
shelves, filled to the brim with various works of arcane lore. From all

Awakenings~
Sleepy eyed, you peer around your surroundings and are shocked to find that
you are no longer in the same place where you went to sleep! In fact, you
have no idea "where" you are. You are surrounded by a faintly glowing
fog and can see nothing in any direction. The ground beneath you is solid,
yet looks very ethereal in nature. You faintly recall various
transportation spells used by various spellcasters throughout the realm.
The fog vaguely reminds you of the residue left over by one of these
spells, however it is much different. As you ponder you current dilemma,
a loud voice cuts through the fog and booms: "Welcome brave souls! Hurry
along and do not tarry in the realm of sleep."
  Just as the the word "sleep" leaves the unknown speaker's mouth, a

is the largest and most elaborate of the four, possibly indicating that it
is for someone of higher ranking or status. Regardless, these chairs are
much to large for someone of human size to use comfortably. On the wall,
behind the chairs, is a large woven tapestry depicting the crest of dream
keep. Facing the large table and chairs are several rows of benches. As
with most other areas of the keep, this large council chamber is illuminated by
several globes of light that hang suspended from the ceiling.

The nobles' quarter~
This small and richy furnished chamber is the entrance to the keep's noble
quarter. Lush red carpeting starts in the center of this elaborate room and
continues through the northern exit. To the south, nothing can be seen but
an all consuming darkness. It is so dark that the globes illuminating the
chamber cannot even begin to penetrate its gloomy interior. The eastern exit
is dark and dreary, and as you look, a sudden feeling of uneasiness settles
about you. In contrast, the western exit is brightly lit.

No footprints can be seen crossing the dust covered floor of this ancient,

of presence can be felt from the corridor, radiating a deep burning hatred
for you and all other life as well.

Large crystal chandeliers cast their hypnotic light across the smooth walls
of this small, stone chamber. The room begins to waiver as the walls suddenly
begin to sag and melt, leaving large puddles of dream aether on the tiled
floor. They slowly bein to creep towards the center of the floor, taking with
them the tiles and even the stone beneath them. The ceiling sways and slowly
sags in the center as it folds inwards on itself, forming another mass of
aether. It slowly congeals itself and moves towards the other puddle that is
now rising to meet it. The two puddles begin to swirl about each other slowly,
rapidly gaining intensity until a virtual vortex of swirling aether is created.
You begin to feel yourself being drawn in towards the vortex. The only means
of escape is to the south.

Unlike most of the keep, illumination here is provided by several large 
torches, hanging from sconces high overhead on the vaulted ceiling. The air
is noticably warm, causing perspiration to form at the edges of your brow.
Fantastic murals adorn every wall, seperated by several ornate stained glass
hangings. Torch light, reflected and refracted by the hangings, causes a
myriad of bright colors to splay across the tiled floor. A large curtain
covers the northern wall and a darkened exit is to the south.
