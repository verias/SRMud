faerie~
a faerie flutters in the air~
A small faerie flutters here, its white wings shimmering.
~
Deep green robes drape over the small frame of this faerie.  Her eyes are a 
deep blue, like the skies at midnight, and sparkle even in the dimmest of 
lights.  The only thing keeping the golden curls that spill in a cloud 
around her shoulders out of her face is an ornate clip decorated with a 
lily.  Her lips and skin themselves seem to sparkle and shine with a light 
of their own.  White wings reminiscent of a butterfly's sprout from this 
faerie's back.  Each wing is adorned with powder-blue markings, and shimmers 
in a similar manner to her skin.

Fluttering black and purple wings carry this faerie through the air.  Deep 
purple hair shines like an amethyst in sunlight as it spills over this naked 
faerie's form, almost completely covering her torso.  The rest of her lithe 
body seems to shimmer, as pale as the moon.  Glittering green eyes look you 
over haughtily as she flits beyond your reach.

hue, fluttering silently as she moves.

coated in silver dust.  Long hair the colour of ancient oak is buffeted by 
the large silvery butterfly wings, masking and revealing its naked form as

as a smile graces its face.

~
Gossamer robes mask the pert figure that dances before you, humming an 
ancient melody to itself.  Silver tinted skin almost shines with an inner 
radiance on the exposed flesh of hands, feet and face.  As it glances up you 
cannot help but notice a light smattering of freckles upon its finely 
chiseled features, complimented by bright blue eyes that look at you with 
amused interest.  Crowning its brow is hair the colour of sun-ripened corn.

A silver horn spirals majestically into the air from this equestrian's 
forehead, contrasting vividly with its deep blue coat.  Long hairs at the 
base of the legs covering the top of each silver, cloven hoof.  The mane, 
tail, and beard spill in silver splashes around the dark beast.  The eyes of 
the unicorn glimmer like stars in the night sky, drinking in all its 
surroundings readily.  Easily standing twenty five hands in height, he seems 
to be at ease in any setting.

This faery has a smattering of freckles over her sharp features.  Her eyes 
are quick and bright, a shining blue that seems to take everything in within 
a glance.  Two sharp ears protrude from her mass of curling orange hair, 
half of which is pulled into a pony tail high at the back of her head.  Her 
wings shimmer a translucent blue as they flap in a flurry behind her, 
keeping her in the air at all times.  She is dressed in a bright green frock 
and grins impishly at you when you enter.

This four foot long dragon is covered in bright iridescent scales that 
change from molten spring green to a dappled magenta.  Its snout tapers to a 
fanged maw, but these threatening features don't quite make it look 
dangerous.  Four great wings that are tattered at the ends sprout from its 
back, made of a translucent iridescence that has cooler tones than the 
scales, flashing blue and green as they flutter.

A tiny red fire drake sits here, gazing about with shimmering eyes akin to 
crystal prisms.  Thin, spiralled horns sweep back from the to of its 
fine-featured head, giving it a bit of an inquisitive cast when considered 
with its long tapered muzzle and sharp looking teeth.  Its form cannot be 
over eighteen inches in total length and is covered in glinting scales that 
look like rubies in any light.  Two thirds of the creatures length is 
composed of slender neck and delicate tail while the remainder is a 
slim-looking body.  Three-toed paws that have opposable thumbs permit it to 
grasp most surfaces that it comes across.  A pair of red bat-like wings 
grows from just behind its shoulders, possessing a similar colour to 
the;scales and are topped with small talons upon the leading knuckle.

Shimmering eyes of a gentle orange shade gaze about from a slender tapering 
head that terminates in a narrow snout.  Tiny fangs can be seen within its 
mouth, which might appear far more fearsome if the creature was more than 
eighteen inches long.  Golden scales cover its whole body, only being absent 
from its orange bat-like wings, their hue becoming lighter over its stomach 
and darker along its spine.  Three-toed clawed paws with opposable thumbs 
grace the tiny feet of the slightly built, slim, draconic form that coils 
here.

A large black bat waits here with a harness about its body.
~
Looking very much like its smaller brethren ,this giant bat waits in a 
docile manner.  Soft looking black fur covers its plumb body while its large 
wings have a velvety texture to them.  Large ears stand up from its head, 
twitching to any sounds as its dark eyes glint in the available light.  
Slowly it opens its mouth, revealing a fairly impressive set of sharp fangs, 
before shutting it once again.  One thing that seems unusual about this 
beast is that its body is crisscrossed with a leather harness that 
appears to have hoops and even a small saddle attached to it.

A winged woman who calls herself Blossom sits here.
~
A slight figure approximately a foot in height rests here on one of the lily 
pad-shaped cushions.  An air of serenity surrounds her, reinforced with the 
friendly smile that is always playing over her lips, an expression that 
makes her cornflower blue eyes sparkle.  She is dressed in clothes that are 
either fashioned from plants or created to look as if they were.  A cap that 
looks like an upside-down flower rests on her head, partially covering the 
golden blonde hair that spills to her back.  Leaves and other flower petals 
fashion the dress she wears, ornately gathered together by invisible means.  
Her wings look soft and fragile with delicate spots of color over their 
gossamer white, sprouting from her back.  The faint aroma of apple blossoms 
surrounds her.

The man before you is approximately a foot and a half tall in height.   His 
hair sticks up in wayward brown spikes, looking like a rather lethal hair 
style.  His clothing is very strange--the edges have been hemmed in a ragged 
pattern that produces an asymmetry and appears to be made of plants of some 
sort.  He wears an apron about his waste, from which a tape measure and a 
few scraps of material hang out of.  He watches you intently as if 
to appraise you with his hazel colored eyes as he flutters here, waiting 
for the next order.

Clothes like holly leaves barely covers the tiny form of this faerie girl

though that is dispelled somewhat when she glances at you with deep purple 
eyes and flashes a welcoming smile.  Twin pairs of purple wings of a pale 
translucence are at rest, flowing from her back with a strange grace.  Long 
blue hair frames her face and tumbles between her wings, which does nothing 
to hide the pair of long tapering ears that grace her head.

Foxglove~
A faerie that looks sad and battered glides through the air here.
~
Pink-purple skin covers the slight and tiny form of the figure before you.  
She glances up through her unmanageable shoulder length blue-purple hair 
from her sitting position at your appearance.  Two ears poke out of the said 
mass, long and tapering to a point as they poke out of her hair.  Her slight 
body is wrapped in a diaphanous purple fabric that barely conceals her body 
and appears torn due to its disorderly design.  Long boots formed of a 
similar material reach up to mid-thigh, ending there in a trimming of spine 
like filaments.  Her small, delicate hands are covered with fine gloves of 
the same design as the rest of her clothing, ending in spikes and tatters.  
Spines sweep backward from her lithe form, originating around her shoulder 
blades, and the wings stretching between them terminate in a fashion that 
matches her clothing; ragged and uneven.

Harlequin~
An elegantly dressed faerie is here, prancing around energetically.
~
Clad in a costume of black and white alternating diamonds, this figure flies 
about on cream and black butterfly wings that compliment her mode of dress 
well.  Form fitting stockings show off her long, shapely legs while a 
checkered Basque that shows off her generous chest and clinches her already 
admirably small waist.  From the base of the corset, a short cream skirt 
flairs out, trimmed in black.  Raven dark hair tumbles from her head, 
reaching past her breasts as it waves to her movements.  A half-mask partly 
conceals her features fashioned from a shell that has been painted in the 
same white and black pattern and is hooked behind her slim, pointed ears.  
Bell sleeves starting just below the shoulders and flaring out at the 
wrists, bearing the same pattern as her stockings to cover her arms.  Fixed 
to the back of her basque are trailing streamers of a light fabric that 
holds the same pattern as the rest of her clothing.

Fern~
A green faerie is here, playing a soulful tune on her panpipes.
~
The figure sitting before you cannot be feasibly more than a foot and a half 
in height when standing.  Her sharp features look innocent and child-like as 
she plays an artful tune upon a set of panpipes.  She has green skin that 
matches the grass that covers her form, making her appear naked, or nearly 
so.  Forest green hair that is cropped short covers her head, matched by 
short furry black antenna.  The length of her hair does nothing to cover the 
long ears jutting from her hair, clearly tapering to points.  Delicate wings 
of a translucent white color emerge from her back, fluttering slowly while 
she is at rest.  As she plays, she turns her vivid green eyes on you, 
seeming to look into your very soul.

acorn faerie~
Acorn~
A faerie flits through the air here, darting about freely.
~
Short, spiky black-red hair crowns the diminutive figure of this faerie 
before you.  His height is approximately two feet or so in total, though the 
flittering movement and the spiked hair might lead to this estimation being 
in accurate.  Nut-brown skin covers the muscled and toned form, contrasting 
sharply with his scarlet eyes.  Dragonfly like irradiant wings in two pairs 
sprout from his shoulders, moving with glimmering speed to propel the figure 
through the air.

drummond faerie~
Drummond~
A faerie with red and black wings reorganizes the lights here.
~
Conscientiously working with barely a mutter of indignation at the task he 
has to accomplish, this faerie flutters about checking that the silver 
lights are in order.  His long brown-blonde hair has been loosely fashioned 
into a ponytail so as not to get in the way of his blue eyes while working.  
A pair of red and black patterned butterfly wings keeps him aloft as he 
labours, flittering constantly in a flurry of motion.  What can be seen of 
his body appears to be trim and well muscled, clearly used to an outdoor 
life.

Orchid~
A stunning faerie is here, playing a long-forgotten melody on her harp.
~
A faerie with a soft peaches-and-cream complexion rests here, her face an 
expression of deep thought as her pale blue eyes stare at the far wall.  
Hair darker than the night radiates from her head in a wild mass, thought 
its appearance is in no way uncomplimentary.  She seems like a fully grown 
woman due to her full figure that is covered only by a revealing dress.  The 
dress seems to be made of petals two of which are long and cross over her 
breasts to tie behind her neck.  The far from modest skirt she wears seems 
to be layers upon layers of the same white petals.  Fragile-looking wings 
lay at rest over her back, two pairs of translucent dragonfly wings.  Her 
hands pluck over the strings of the harp in front of her, producing 
delicate sounds in a strange melody.

Aspen~

~
A heavily muscled man of approximately two feet is here.  His auburn hair 
falls just past his shoulders and brushes the tops of his sturdy wings.  A 
translucent membrane stretches between a heavier substance that makes up a 
frame for the wing, making each flap powerful.  Tattoos of knot work circle 
his biceps, making them stand out further, while over his brow another 
intricate tattoo can just be seen under his wisps of hair.  His hands are 
rough from constant work, with scars working their way from there to his 
elbow.  His chest is left bare to expose more muscle he has gained through 
work, while he wears thick trousers on his legs.

Chestnut brown hair with streaks of blonde brush over the neck of this 
faerie, looking almost as if sun-kissed.  His skin is reminiscent of the 
color of almonds, looking soft despite the heavy muscling of his arms and 
chest.  Circling his upper arms and his forehead, bands of an unknown 
material can be found, crested with strange runes.  He works constantly upon 
one of the weapons found within his domain, his diligence shining through in 
their quality.

intricately and is dotted with what appears to be dew and tiny irridescent 
beads, leaving her tapering ears clearly exposed to any observer.  Her face 
is smooth but angular, giving her a mischievous look whenever she smiles.  
High, thin eyebrows add to her sense of frailty and give her a somewhat

This dainty figure is approximately a foot tall.  She has smooth, full, 
pouty lips that are a soft shade of red-pink.  Her skin is a delicate 
white-pink, somewhat like white flower petals with visible veins.  A cap 
made entirely of tulip petals covers her forehead and cascades down her 
back, all of them a bright red that never fades, as if they had life even in 
their present state.  Her dress is made of pink petals of the same type 
gracing her head, the design of which leaves much of her bosom exposed.

dark green covering her body exposed.  The marks seem to be part of her 
skin, like a tattoo, and create intricate patterns with a chaotic twist of 
small tendrils coming off the larger ones.  When she looks up from her book 
and at you, you can see that her eyes are an amber-gold color that offset 
her red hair attractively.

Silent stories of extremity play over the shimmering surface of this 
mirror-like faerie tale.  Roses, beautiful women, knights in armor 
(sometimes black, sometimes shining) riding noble steeds, hags, fae of all 
types, forests, and enchanted lakes can all be seen if you gaze into the 
glimmering surface long enough.  Even through the lack of sound, the 
profundity of the actions displayed are clear through the reactions; smiling 
and laughter, great anger, bitterness, envy, and much more can be seen in 
the characters while the stories play out.

A wise-looking faerie stands here, lecturing the students present.
~
This fae wears a blue felt hat that has a triangular shape, the edges of 
which are curled.  This hat fails to conceal his pointed ears and a long 
pony tail of chestnut colored hair emerges from beneath the trendy cloth to 
rest at an end between his shoulder blades.  He has bright blue-violet eyes 
that shine when he smiles, making his angular features seem that much more 
receptive and friendly.  Clear membrane stretches between bone-like 
protrusions from his back to form his wings, which nearly touch the floor 
when at rest.  He is dressed entirely in blue and white and looks very 
official, for a faerie.  He points to a drawing board beside him, which 
seems to hold a complex formula for the trajectory of cherry stones.

sun, shining radiantly from her delicate and angular face.  Small wings that 
look somewhat weak flitter from time to time from her back, their soft blue 
color the same as the flowers in her hair.  She looks around avidly before 
returning her gaze to the instructor and his drawing board.

Leaves and twigs have been tangled within the green and blonde locks of hair 
that this faerie possesses, giving him, ultimately, a wild look.  His skin 
is golden brown, attesting the fact that he spends as much time outdoors as 
possible.  He has a book full of butterflies, their names, and very detailed 
depictions, which he seems to have made himself.  His wings are more 
dragonfly-like, the thin green membrane stretched taut between the sturdier

her paw like hands and feet, but the rest of her body is covered in

bucked front teeth and a harelip sits under a pair of large clear blue eyes, 
giving the face an innocent cast.  Long rabbit ears with pink insides and 
white fur on the outside crown her head.  Down like white fur grows down 
from her elbows and knees ending at her hands and large feet, the pristine 
color contrasting with her delicate-looking pastel pink skin.  An overly 
large chest bounces about as she moves with a wiggle that also causes the 
brilliant white fluffy ball of a tail on her bottom to sway almost 
hypnotically below her slender waist.

his animalistic ties.  His almost-black eyes seem to shine and his nose and 
whiskers wiggle from side to side as he pauses to look at you.  Hair of a 
darker brown, almost black, shade runs in twin stripes over his back and to 
his long, thin tail.  The tail is approximately the same length of his body 
and stretches out behind him, bearing a single stripe.  Short brown fur 
grows from his elbows and knees down to the end of each limb.  As he opens 
his mouth, you can see that his front teeth are sharp and slightly bucked.

rounded ears covered in a rich brown fur.  Tanned skin covers his toned 
body, causing his pink mouse-like tail to be all the more apparent.  His 
whiskers quiver in time with his nose's wiggling movements while his dark 
eyes scan the area, looking constantly for danger.  From just below his 
elbows, short brown fur grows to his wrists and the same occurs between his 
knees and feet.  Both his hands and feet are tipped with tiny claws, opposed 
to the nails of most other humanoids.  He moves about nimbly, appearing 
unconscious of his own nudity or its implications.

bosom.  It is open-backed to allow her white and black wings to move freely
as she wills it.  Her sharp featured face is more poignant due to some
carefully tamed spikes that are shaped to look like a lick of flame.  Small
black antennae that have slightly bulbous ends grow from her forehead, not
at all hidden by her bright red hair.  She has eyes that are pure blue,
lacking notable signs of both pupils and irises, so it is difficult to tell
if she is looking at you, or through you.  She introduces herself as the
body sculptor and beckons for you to see her designs, so that she might
modify you.

Candi~
A white winged faerie woman is here, selling foods and drinks.
~
Surprisingly svelte for someone that deals all day with sweet foods and
drinks.  Candi has completely white hair and wings, her eyes are a pale
green and her features very sharp.  If it wasn't for the welcoming smile on
her lips, she would look hard, almost like a marble statue.

Sorsha one winged faerie~
Sorsha~
A one winged faerie works quietly in the corner here.
~
Midnight blue hair which has been cropped short then spiked crowns the
head of this white skinned faerie girl.  She only wears black thigh boots
and a pair of shiny black briefs.  Her bare breasts show small bars through
her nipples and her belly button has also been adorned, this time with a
wing.  Pure red eyes lacking irises and whites regard you briefly before she
resumes making a new whip with utmost care.  A single red and black
butterfly wing can be seen on her back, as you look more closely you notice
that where the other wing should be there is only the bud and a few tattered
strands.

This type of whip is said to only be made from reeds that grow on
lightning blasted earth and that the runes are those of pain and torment,
which may only be fashioned by a mage who is in agony and should ideally be
scribed in that magic user's blood.  Not too surprisingly that these objects
fetch a high price.  Normally pixies will go to great lengths of obtain one
of these implements of torture.

Within the Forest~
Plants struggle to thrive in the evershade created by the thick canopy
above.  The nearest tree is a stately oak, its age indeterminable but
appearing ancient all the same with moss covering its bark like fur covers
an animal.  Tiny lights have been strung between its branches, shaped like
miniature lilies and providing a soft illumination at best.  Condensation or
droplets left over from the last rainstorm drip all around, occasionally
striking any passerby.

Ancient Woods~
A sapling struggles to grow within this forest, doing its best to thrive
in the sunlight that reaches this area during the day.  Grasses and other
wild growths amalgamate here, making it difficult to pass without destroying
their inherent beauty.  The bright blooms that range through the colors of
the rainbow release a delicate scent that hovers in the air whenever it is
still, though it's blown away by the slightest breezes.  Great trees can be
seen all around, their leaves and bark seeming to possess an inner glow from
the bright hues.

Among Bright Flowers~
Sweeping stems of emerald green grasses grow with gay abandon here, 
stretching their leafy bodies towards the sky.  Interspersed with the grass 
are countless wildflowers in a rainbows profusion of colours sending forth 
there aromas as a heady perfume for any to sample upon the air.  Ancient 
gnarled trees of monolithic sizes surround the clearing, the leafy boughs of 
these stretching up and towards each other like dancers in a king's court.

Walking Through Strange Growth~
A tree with soft, jagged leaves grows here.  The trunk is crooked and
splits low to the ground, indicating that it received large amounts of water
in its early years.  Some of its branches are low to the ground, nearly
touching the flowers and grasses growing in thickets there.  A faint scent
permeates the air, presumably wafting from the plentiful blooms that have
opened to the sun's coaxing.  More trees of varying types grow all around. 
Everything in this area looks brighter than life.

Long grass covers the ground all about, stiff blades of vegetation that
point proudly skyward.  Prospering blooms intermix with the bright green
ferns and grass, their colors something a rainbow could be jealous of.  Deep
within the thickets, the sounds of small animals and insects can be heard
from time to time.  Different types of deciduous trees grow all around this
cleared spot, their leaves never fading or falling from their branches.

a multitude of shapes, some of them jagged and soft, the others stiff and
spear-like with a waxy surface.

A Gigantic Tree~
Orchids wind around the limbs of the tree that grows here, hanging
loosely between them like tiny flowering bridges.  Bright green leaves, like
those freshly unfurling in spring time, grow densely above, forming a thick
canopy.  Droplets of water fall gently from the tree as the wind rustles its
leaves, whether they are from the last rain storm or some sort of
condensation, it is hard to determine.  Small lights that look like flowers
of a vastly diminuitive size have been strung around the tree trunk and a
few of its limbs, providing light in its evershade.

A Magnificent Glade~
Long, leafy grasses grow here, bowing to the earth because they are
unable to support their own weight.  Betwixt the blue-green vegetation,
numerous flowers grow.  Their petals have opened to the sun's passing,
exposing the pistil and stamen to the air, and, consequently, the bees that
are drifting by.  Some daisies mix in with the daffodils and lilies,
creating a pleasing disarray.  The trees surrounding the edges of this glade
appear to be ancient, their gnarled and twisted souls reaching for the sun.

A Pond~
Reeds and cattails grow at the edges of this pond, protecting it from the 
elements with their heighth.  Some leaves that have floated down from the 
aged trees overhead drift along the water's surface, moving lazily through 
the water.  Lily pads can be spotted throughout the pool, intertwined with 
algae.  Further away from the water's edge, blossoms flourish alongside 
grass, located beneath the large trees that make up the forest beyond.

Near a Willow Tree~
Gently lapping waters slosh against the dense reed beds of this pool, 
lapping a soft tune as the wash strikes.  Bulrushes thicker than a grown 
man's thumb tops some of the reeds, appearing like torches ready to be lit 
for a parade.  The occasional bloom-blessed lily pad drifts upon the waters 
of the pond, slave to the wind's will.  From deep within the hidden depths 
of the reeds, a croaking from the throat of a frog echoes out over the pool. 
Small bright blossoms grow upon the bank leading like a carpet to the base 
of a giant weeping willow, the boughs of this plant bowed down towards the 
water as if in mourning.

weeping willow~
Blade-like leaves dangle from each of this plants whip-like limbs, each 
possessing a darker top to the underside.  The masked trunk of his ancient 
tree has become gnarled and twisted with age, knots forming as limbs have 
become broken over the years, so that protrusions reminiscent of the face of 
a creature can now be seen.

A musical sound cascades around the clearing, tinkling from numerous bells, 
crystals and reed tubes as they move upon the wind's whims.  These small 
items have been strung high in the boughs of surrounding trees along with 
tiny lights no larger than a firefly's tail.  The floor of the glade is 
covered with emerald green grass and a multitude of wildflowers that possess 
colours ranging through the spectrum.  The scents of life and growth seem to 
come from all around and drift up to one's nose here.

A Pool of Water~
Two trees reach over a misty pool, their great boughs like lover's 
arms;stretching towards each other for an embrace but never meeting.  The 
mist;wafts gently from the pool's waters, spiralling its way upwards for a 
few feet before dissipating into the air above its origin.  Emerald green 
moss grows upon the shaded floor, looking soft and furry to the touch.  From 
within this moss, tiny white flowers grow, their bright faces turned 
skyward.  A soft odour of flourishing plant life and delicately scented 
flowers can be detected about the area, coming from all around.

Nightshade sneaks its way through the thriving grass here, producing
elegant flowers with purple leaves and yellow corrolla along its fronds. 
Violet lupine and off-white catnip poke through the carpet of grass and
nightshade, their tall plant structures allowing them to grow in abandon. 
Morning glories creep along the bark of the trees that surround this small
vale, their scent combining with that of the others rather pleasantly in
the air.

An ivy-shrouded tree grows gracefully from this lush green glade.  The 
mighty limbs of this tree reach skywards for the sun's radiance as the ivy 
climbs over its boughs with its insidious attempt to best its giant host.  
Spear like blades of grass carpet this area, radiating outwards like 
soldiers upon a drill field.  Bright cornflowers peek their faces through 
the grasses, adding a vivid splash of colour to this area.  From the 
flower's blossoms, presumably, the scents drift over the dell and into the 
air.

An oak of mighty proportions stands here, its great trunk and formidable
limbs entwined with a dense growth of ivy that stretches over the floor link
a shimmering sea of leaves, the colours vivid in any light.  Scampering
about through the ivy can be seen the occasional fleeting form of some small
creature, the speed of its progress making it hard to discern what type of
animal it could be.  Flourishing at a distance from the ancient tree's shade
are patched of bright wildflowers in a multitude of colours, the scents from
which float freely upon the air.

Within a Forest~
Lush grass carpets the earth here, seeming almost too bright to be real. 
Flanking the winding path of wildflower-speckled grass stand ancient,
gnarled trees.  Their limbs seem convoluted, weaving and winding between
each other, as they stretch skywards, covered in places by a emerald green
lichen.  Some of these massive sentinels' roots are exposed from the rich
earth, though the trees clearly seem none the worse for it.  Within these
root formations, caves from the movements of small animals can be seen.  The
air is fresh here, filled with the scents of flowers and plants without any
hint of corruption.

looking very much like a bouquet that might be found at a florist's where
they grow.  Ferns can be spotted at random intervals amongst the thick
growth of wild grass and blossoms, their fronds varying from a silvery-blue
to green.  Trees can be seen in the distance, twisted and gnarled growths
that have patches of luminescence on them.

are mixed together, their orange, red, purple, and yellow blossoms growing
in wild patterns.  When the air is still, the scents of these flowers hangs
over the small glen, strong but not altogether unpleasant.  Some mushrooms
grow here in a ring, their white-spotted red caps standing out amongst the
grasses.

Phira's~
This chamber seems to be produced by combination of magical alteration
and masterful carving: a bench is carved into the wall to the left of the
skillfully made door that serves as the exit eastward, the walls are worn
smooth by an unknown source and the chamber is exquisite in that it has no
flaws whatsoever.  Small flowering plants hang from hooks in the ceiling,
lending the room some brightness and a soft scent that's hard to place. 
Carvings of horses chasing each other over the walls can be seen, seeming to
be nearly animate in the light cast by the tiny lanterns that are hanging
from knobs built into the curving walls.

up around this clearing, their branches meeting at the edges of their

canopy over the dark soil.

Rugged bark covers the exterior of the strange tree that grows here.  The
tree splits into two about eight feet from the floor, each half growing
almost like a separate entity from this point upwards.  Leaves with five
points, like a human's hand, dangle from the boughs and wave down towards
the earth from their perch.  From the ground, wildflowers grow, uncountable
in their numbers and grassy beds from which they send forth their gentle
aromas upon the air.

Tinkling to the wind's tune are delicate chains that drape down from the

green grass carpets the floor to a depth of about two feet, from which
bright blue forget-me-nots spring up from within the thick grass to add
there colours to this area.

Long grass of a striking emerald colour grows about this area, glinting
softly with drops of clean moisture.  Laying half buried within these
grasses is what once must have been a majestic tree akin to those still
standing around this area.  This fallen giant of a tree now bears signs of
decay bright red-capped mushrooms with small white spots grow over its
remains.  From one of its few protruding limbs, an industrious spider has
fashioned a large web, each strand shimmering with dew in any available
light like diamonds around a noble woman's throat.

looking very much like a defeated soul.  Grass grows in abundance here, the
short blades a lively green.  Outside of the tree's domain, ferns of a snowy
white color can be found, some of them larger than others but all of them
bearing majestic fronds.  Tiny lights that turn shades at a slow rate have
been strung around the branches to provide a soft and colorful illumination.

Daffodils, tulips, and tiger lilies grow all around, opened proudly to
display their bright colors in this small glade.  Some silvery white ferns
grow between the scattering of blooms, almost as if they were rivals for the

nature grow, bearing leaves of a color that seems unreal in its intensity.

Small lights and chimes have been strung around the cherry tree here,
nestled against the smooth bark.  Any breezes that chance through this area
carry the aroma of flowers and stir the chimes into a symphonic sound.  Some
cherries have dropped from the branches and rest within the grass, not yet
claimed by the residents of this forest.  Morning glory creeps along the
bark of this tree, the flowers curved delicately in their open state.  Long
green grasses grow from the earth, controlled by the air movements in a
similar manner to the decorations of the tree--only there tune is that like
a gentle sigh.

be seen, closed to protect them from the outside world.  There is a
scattering of cones beneath the tree from seasons passed, opened and left
among brown, dead needles that have been shedded.  The tree looks like a
formidable fortress from any aspect, its branches starting not more than
four feet off the ground.

shining with goodness as they wait to fall earthwards.  Crafted upon the
tree's bark by some unknown hand and art is a shimmering silver pentacle,

side and are a dusty green, their small spear-shaped growths turning
themselves to the sun to the best of their ability.  A few birds call to one
another amidst its branches, their song a pleasant addition to the sounds of

polished so that they shine in the silvery light.  Around the outside of
these alcoves are knot work, ivy and oak carvings each seemingly done by the
same skilled hand and each with great care.

A Wooden Chamber~
Three strings of silvery lights have been bound together and slipped
through the hooks on the ceiling in a design that resembles a flower.  Some
ledges carved from the wood serve as furniture in their moss-covered state,
formed carefully from the walls themselves.  A table has been fashioned from
the wood of the floor in the center of the room, bearing several flowers
that form drinking vessels.  Next to these flowers, a snail's shell that has
been cleaned now clearly functions as a pitcher.

A knot in the tree here has been fashioned into a window seat, carved and
smoothed with time and magic.  When the knot is open, it is easy to see the
branches of the tree and parts of the forest.  Strings of silvery lights
have been loops through hooks in the ceiling and provide a gently
illumination.  In the center of the room, there is a strange structure that
appears to be a pedestal with a bowl crafted at its top.  Small tables have
been arranged around the room, holding small bowls of water and rose petals
that produce a gentle perfume.

The living-wood walls of this chamber have literally been polished to a
mirror finish, reflecting everything that is within the chamber with little
distortion.  Around the circumference, placed against the mirror-walls, are
large and low soft pillows such as might be useful to rest upon.  Strung
from the roof are numerous loops of silver lights, their gently radiance
shining down upon this chamber just to be reflected and sent back from the
walls.  Both the smooth floor and the ceiling are stained in a checkerboard
pattern of alternating light and dark browns.

edges gently dancing on the slightest of drafts.  A small hole in the

The Work Shop~
The living walls of this tree are festooned with countless thin wooden
staves, thorns, and pieces of bone, along with the occasional animal tooth. 
Vines and leather thongs have been wound around slender wooden rods to form
reels ready for usage.  A strange contraption of wood, vine and stone stands
in the middle of the room with a tiny moss padded stool in front of it. 
Bark and shells lay in neat piles against one wall ready to be turned into
armour, along with the moss to be used for padding.

on a shelf than anything else.  Some cushions fashioned to appear like the
lily pads found in frog ponds are scattered around, providing seating for
those that wish to stay and read.  A small desk has been fashioned from the

High above the main area of this chamber, the walls have rectangular
slits set at an angle, their presence allowing all who venture here to see
the outside world.  Strings of silvery lights have been arranged between the
strange windows to provide gentle illumination whenever the sun is not
present.  Hanging from the ceiling at the center of the room, thousands of
crystalline shapes hang from threads, twinkling at the slightest breeze from
the outside world.  The lower half of this room has shelving built into the
walls, each of which are covered in a multitude of books with covers in
every color imaginable.  Some cushions made from lily pads or designed to
appear as if they were that plant have been scattered around the floor,
providing a comfortable reading spot.

Rows of long wooden tables that emerge from the living tree itself have
been carved to be of equal length and width, each being approximately three
or four feet apart from each other to provide sitting room.  Some of the
tables have books left open to a specific page, while others have stacks of
books resting upon them.  The wooden chairs around the tables are
free-standing to allow more comfortable usage.  Paintings of faeries and
mystical creatures cover the walls, their shimmering shades bringing a
lightness to their surroundings.  Dangling from the ceiling, innumerous
models and objects hang from hooks and clink together occasionally when
there is a draft.

A steep hill makes the trail rather rough here, and abruptly so it is,
however, covered in roots and stout weeds that are easy to grasp and they
make climbing the side of it considerably easier.  Beyond this pathway of

some more.  A path can also be seen at the bottom of the hill.

This chamber is cylindrical in shape, approximately twelve feet in

plenty of soft moss for cushioning.  A table shaped in a crescent is in
front of the couch, holding all manner of knick knacks and a bowl of candy. 
Shelves have been cut into the walls to hold even more baubles and
keepsakes, each of which are arranged in their own sense of order.  Vines
creep along the walls and fall in curtains all around, nearly concealing the
exit to the east.  There is a rather clear walkway between the door to the
outside world and that to the east, the space lined with potted plants.

the water running constantly with a soothing sound to join with the pool

creatures hiding within supports the round tabletop found at the middle of
the room, around which are four chairs.  A curtain of ivy hangs over the
western exit, around which are more carvings of flowers and wild growth,
painted into a likeness of the outside world.  At the corners of this vast
room to the north and south, airy stairs lead either up or down to more of
the tree home.

creep their way up the walls, their soft fronds blue-white in color.  More
ivy spills out of the planters and over the walls, making this entire
chamber appear to be alive.  Alcoves narrowly missed by the tumbling masses
of leaves hold spheres and ornaments.  Several hooks have been set into the
ceiling and the pair over the bed holds a chandelier that looks more like
several will-o'-the-wisps circling in the air.  Stairs carved into the tree
itself lead downward from this room and a window can be barely made out to

This balcony has been fitted over the knoll of a tree, giving it an
irregular shape determined by nature's whim.  The overlook has a railing of
sorts around it for the protection of those who linger here, matching the
contour of the tree perfectly.  A branch grows directly overhead, giving the
alcove a considerable amount of protection from the elements and harsh
sunlight.  Two chairs have been placed in the corner of evershade with only
a small wooden table between them.  This choice vantage point allows a view
of the courtyard below of tamed flowers and a delicate bird bath as well as
the pavillion that is to the north of it.  The forest stretches for as far
as the eye can see, a canopy of a rich green that ripples like the sea.

A Hot Spring~
This airy chamber has a vaulted ceiling far above, where swirls of colors
glow softly in the dim light.  A pool of rocks has been fashioned under a
spring here, collecting the steaming water into a pool that ranges from
shallow to deep.  Ivy grows over the rocks and provides a more gentle
surface for those who choose to loiter upon the ledge.  The paper lanterns
strung about the chamber at approximately five feet in height resemble
fireflies when lit, each of them throwing a gentle luminescence.  Along the
walls, several racks have been carved from the living wood, some of which
hold fluffy blue and green towels.  The large arched gape in the eastern
wall has two wood and glass doors set into it.  The panes of glass have had
decorative patterns etched into them that cause any rays of light that pass
through them to fragment into rainbows.  A narrow stone stairwell leads
downward to a moss-covered rock, while a second staircase that is much more
open leads upward.

A small bowl on a pedestal has been placed next to the stone door,
bearing some stones of varying colors.  A pricker bush flourishes around the
pedestal, making it difficult to get to its contents without some measure of
discomfort.  All around the edges of the ceiling, lights of varying shades
have been set to give very dim illumination, which seems to make it slightly
more ominous when a table with dark vines over it comes into view.  Next to
this strange combination of vine and wood is a bowl on a pedestal, holding
strange contraptions of its own that look somewhat dangerous in their own
right.  More of the same vines have emerged from the walls at varying spots,
seemingly planned to be ankle, wrist, and waist heighths.  Roots from the
tree growing overhead jut out from the walls like grasping fingers, curled
and hook-like where they emerge.  A fire burns in a hole surrounded in stone
to the south, providing warmth throughout the chamber.

the free-standing roof, leaving it to look more like a wild temple.  All
around this tamed space are wildflowers, brush, and trees growing close and
thick, their presence making this area seem secluded and private.  Roses can
be seen peeking out of the bush to the north, and the gentle scent coming
from their pink-red blossoms fills the air.  A pathway of cedar chips and
moss leads away to a garden to the south, and deeper into the forest
eastward.

jumping through the trees and the song of wild birds are an assurance that
this is an untamed piece of land, despite the rock and tree growing in the
middle of the small clearing, looking very much like an intentional resting
place due to their shape and placing.  A pathway of cedar chips and moss
leads to the west, with wild flowers, grass, and brush growing at its edges.

The wooden frame of this bed has been covered in a very thick and soft
blue-green moss that serves as excellent cushioning for its occupants.  Lush
ivy with speckled periwinkle and hunter colored leaves tumble from the rods
that pass between the bed posts, creating a thick curtain that divides this
space from the rest of the world.  Small fire-fly like lights have nestled
against the leaves to provide very dim lighting, casting off just enough
illumination to make out shapes and colors, but nothing invading or harsh. 
The silence is easy and helps reinforce the feeling that this is a sanctuary
in which one can escape the outside world.

The Twilight Grove~
The forest turns from its ordinary coloring to misty shadows here.  The
trees are grey-black and grow without hardship, their leafy fronds covered
in slightly luminescent leaves of a star shape.  The flowers seem to be made
of the same darkness, surreal and ethereal in its nature, where the stems
are the color of the tree trunks and their flowers like the leaves in all
aspects, save for the shapes.  A plant that grows close to the ground with a
thick stem for its base stands out from the rest, being a lighter shade of
grey and having literally thousands of pinpricks of light covering its
spindly branches.  This strange growth is surrounded by small stones that
seem composed of light, arranged in a perfection, almost as if containing
the plant within its circumference.  Specks of golden light float through
the air, appearing at first to be at the wind's whim until they shiver and
swirl around without provocation.

making it all but impossible to stray from the trail.  A few blooms stand
out from the rest, a brilliant purple or white amidst the shadow plants and,
in return, a few shade flowers have mixed with the bright flowers on the
easter side of this pathway.

A Path in the Woods~
Many types of trees mix and mingle at the edges of this path, leading both 
east and west.  Leaves from seasons past litter the ground, some of them 
piling up in small pools of water to rot away into nothingness.  A few trees 
are toppled, probably ripped from the soft marshy ground by gales of wind 
just to be deposited on their sides to become hosts for all manners of 
slimey creatures and fungal growths.  Most of the trees, however, are still 
upright and growing strongly in competition of each other for the sun's 
life-giving rays.

Long flowering vines dangle down from the surrounding trees, one end leading

decorating these vines tinkle musically to each command of the wind or 
simply sparkle like fallen stars if light should happen to strike them.  
Lush grass grows in abundance under the gnarled limbs of the trees, speckled 
in places with wildflowers that readily lend their fragrances to the air 
here as well as the occasional wind blown leaf.

A Grassy Clearing~
Long grasses sway softly to the winds command here, their heads heavy with 
seeds waiting to spill so that new life can once more spring forth.  Around 
the outer edge of this clearing tall trees stand, their convoluted branches 
reaching towards the heavens like supplicants to the sun.  Sprinkled within 
the grasses are numerous wild flowers, the bright colors and gentle scents 
making what could otherwise be a boring and drab place much more pleasant to 
one's eye.  A soft, almost musical tinkling sound resonates throughout this 
clearing, the source unclear from this location.

In the Canopy~
Small branches and twigs have been cleared from the limbs of these trees, 
allowing for easier movement along the flowering vines that form a primitive 
net.  A delicate aroma comes from these plants, soft and unsullied by any 
hint of corruption or decay.  Some of the vines have clearly been looped so 
as to give swings within the tree's branches, while others lead down to the 
floor below.  Small bells have been carefully placed within the flowers of 
the vines that send forth a harmonious tune, should they sound.  One oddity 
here is that some of the bark seems to have been stripped from the trees, 
not enough to do the plant harm but akin to the after effects of claws or 
teeth.

A Lonesome Pine~
A single pine tree, large even in comparison to the other trees ringing this 
clearing, stands here.  Its massive branches almost touch the floor while 
its tip points straight upwards, each limb covered in sharp needles.  Around 
the clearing, numerous pine cones are scattered that at first appear to be 
at random, as if fallen from the tree, but with closer inspection seem to be 
markers of some sort.  From within the flourishing grasses a plentitude of 
flowers grow the bright reds, blues and yellows seeming to follow a design 
analogous to the pine cones.  Upon the air, a sound similar to what one would 
expect to come from tiny bells can be heard, unobtrusive and possessing 
something of a musical quality.

A Singing Path~
The air here is filled with music somehow in harmony with its self.  These 
sounds come from various wind chimes and bells attached cunningly to the 
ancient trees that surround the area.  Swaying grasses carpet the floor, the 
vibrant greens contrasting with the blues of the flowers that grow in the 
shelter of the trees safe from both the elements and clumsy feet.  The 
scents of the forest are strong here, mingling with the frangrance of the 
blue flowers to produce something boarding on the spectacular when the music 
is also considered.

A Decorated Boulder~
A tall stone stands alone within this forest glade, its surface artfully 
carved to depict a spiral in green and grey, the green coloration coming 
from a moss that must have been planted by some forgotten hand in the 
pattern while the grey comes from the stone's own surface.  Grasses heavy 
with seeds sway to the wind's command, bowing before the stone then rising 
once more as the air passes.  Intermixed with the grasses are bunches of 
wildflowers, the delicate colors and fragrances from these mixing with the 
scent of the earth to produce a pleasing aroma.

A Natural Garden~
Multicolored patches of moss cover the trees that line this flower-filled 
copse, almost as if by design.  The dense greenery above belonging to these 
ancient denizens of the forest does not succeed in totally blocking out 
natural light and instead causes it to dapple as it filters to the forest 
floor.  Brilliant flowers in yellows, blues, and reds grow intermittenly 
amongst the soft green clover that carpets the forest ground, their 
arrangement more orderly than the normal chaos of nature.

An Odd Cage~
A large cage-like structure fashioned from living willow saplings stands in 
the middle of what is otherwise a clearing.  The bars of the cage are spaced 
easily two feet apart with the limbs of the willows forming simple cross 
bracers to help keep the shape and lend the design strength.  No doorway 
seems to lead into the curious structure, through the earth inside bears the 
marks of animal and faerie feet.  Tall trees, mostly of willow, surround the 
clearing.  From some of the branches of these willows, hang the occasional 
tiny bell that climes to the wind's desires.

A Willow Walk~
Graceful willow trees lines a wiggling path that works its way through the 
forest.  From within the delicate, bowed branches of these plants a few tiny 
bells can be heard more than seen, though the occasional metallic glint does 
appear.  Long grasses with the tips weighed down by seeds cover the ground, 
swaying if the wind should happen across their stems.  A soft tinkling tune 
comes from the bells, drifting about the pathway as the boughs sway softly.  
The odor of wildflowers and the earth fills the air, easily masked by any 
stronger scent that should happen to be present.

A gentle chiming sound resonates throughout this area produced by tiny 
little bells hung discreetly within the gnarled limbs of the trees that 
surround the area.  Poppies carpet the floor their bright red blossoms 
having all but over taken the grass here, from these plants a heady scent 
drifts forth somewhat powerful in its intensity.  The interlaced branches 
overhead prevent the full effects of the sun reaching the ground here, 
allowing the delicate blooms that litter the earth to flourish.

Across a Deer Path~
The caked mud of this trail is scarred by the passage of deer hooves and 
other heavy animals that have passed through since the last good rain.  
Blades of grass struggle here and there within the well-traversed ground, 
trying to overcome the adversity presented to them.  A few large trees arch 
over the pathway, their branches laden with strange fruits in addition to 
their deep green leaves.  Whenever the foliage rustles with the wind, a soft 
tinkling of bells fills the air, their chimes pleasant and complimentary of 
each other.

A huge oak tree is here, stretching away to the heavens with its great 
branches.  Among the grooves of the bark, mosses have taken seed and 
flourished, looking incredibly like it is smiling at you due to the design 
being two small round patches and a semi-circle beneath them.  The tinkling 
of bells with complimentary pitches fills the air, their origin seeming to 
be somewhere within the foliage of this monstrosity called a tree.

Rough rocks jut out from the dark earth in various places, making it 
considerably more uneven than the random fallen tree seems to in the other 
parts of the woods.  Bright mushrooms climb the trunks of most of the trees 
in this particular spot, whether they are thriving alive or already starting 
to rot.  Delicate flowers and tiny bells decorate the vines that snake 
between the tree branches above, their length draping so their loops are 
rather close to the forest floor.

Whenever the wind stirs, the mingling scents of rotting foliage and fragrant 
wildflowers reaches all who tarry here.  Drifting along with this 
not-so-unpleasant smell is the chime of bells that are hidden somewhere in 
the trees that still stand.  The ground is a myriad of colors due to the 
animals that roam through here, leaving behind seed deposits in various 
ways.  Poppies, bluebells, daisies, and paintbrushes mix altogether in a 
pleasing array that only nature could be responsible for.

The trees here are strange indeed!  They appear to be willows, but instead 
of yellow-green bark their skins are deep purple in color.  The leaves are a 
bright {mpurple{x color that shine with an irridescence under natural light, 
shimmering blues and greens and pinks in addition to their normal hue.  
Silver bells have been strung and twined over the branches, producing a 
melodic ringing whenever the wind stirs them or a passerby bumps into the 
them.

The Painting Tree~
A large tree stands here, the trunk stripped totally of bark while the top 
still seems to thrive; upon the cleared surface of the tree innumerable tiny 
pictures have been painted to create a mural of sorts upon the still living 
wood.  From within the branches of this tree and those surrounding the 
clearing, miniature bells can just be made out, from which a delicate melody 
is created.  Small flowers dot the floor, the bright colors of which seem to 
almost shine as if illuminated from within, whether this is some magical 
effect or a trick of the light it is uncertain.  A strange formation of 
trees can be seen to the south.

Grand trees that are covered in smooth bark as dark as night grow here, 
glistening a silver color under light.  The leaves are translucent and 
shaped like stars, seeming to hold an inner light of their own that varies 
in color with the temperature.  Flowers with green petals are here, their 
stems vividly colored in the inverse of what a normal plant looks like, 
their skins varying like a rainbow does.  The sounds of bells chiming in 
chorus reach this spot, their song pleasant though their source is not 
apparent.

The star-shaped leaves on the trees here are translucent and grow with a 
soft luminescence of their own, their color varying and changing 
periodically.  The skin of the trees is glossy and smooth, and should any 
light strike the deep black, it reflects in a silver tone.  Strings of bells 
can be seen wound tightly through the limbs of these otherworldly trees, 
ringing each time they sway under the wind's power.  The flowers seem to be 
confused, their stems are vivid gem-like colors that do not match the 
emerald green of normal plants, while their petals seem to have a green 
tint.

Translucent leaves with a soft pastel glow from the branches of these odd 
plants, their colors shifting and changing slowly from time to time.  The

A still pool sits in the centre of this clearing,, its surface like a mirror

grow, their red caps speckled with large white spots, and the earth under 
these fungi barren.  Around the circumference of the clearing mighty trees 
stand silent watch, their gnarled limbs intertwined with each other's or 
reaching towards the heavens above.  Within the confines of the ancient 
trees branches minuscule bells can be seen a delicate melody being produced 
by these as the wind filters past them.

sparkle light stars in the night sky due to the water droplets covering 
them.  The air is still and holds a pleasant scent, in fact it is too still, 
almost as if all the animals that should be in a forest were holding their 
breath and waiting for something.  Large trees with bark as black as coal 
grace the edges of this field of clover, their leaves star shaped and 
translucent.

Gnarled trees of an eerie white wood line the weaving path here, their 
branches reaching out like skeletal hands awaiting the unwary to entrap.  
Strange black barked bramble and briar grow under these white trees, the 
contrast causing the smaller plants to seem even more menacing.  From within 
the underbrush skittering and scampering sounds can be heard, though the 
sources are hidden by the dense plant growth.  The path way makes its 
irregular route from the east to the west.

trees line the track, their white limbs seeming to reach out as if to 
ensnare anyone who should happen along it.  Glancing closer at these eerie 
plants it becomes apparent that most have had small holes bored into their 
surfaces, possibly a source of the strange keening.  Located under the 
trees, almost as if they are attempting to hide, are small bunches of purple 
flowers that send forth a delicate, if somewhat otherworldly aroma.  An 
erratic path winds between the trees here, working its way from the west to 
the north like some serpent moving between the trees.

contagion when more closely inspected.  The trees beyond the brush are 
grey-white in color, raising like skeletal hands from the black swamp muck 
surrounding their trunks.  The easiest paths away from this spot seem to be

Skeletal trees pierce the stagnant water, raising their crooked fingers to

over the surface of the muck, stirred by the wind.  The air is unnaturally 
still, lacking all the telltale signs of life that usually disquiet 
forestland.  White mushrooms grow in patches around the soft, muddy path, 
adding tidbits of color to the monotony of the blackness.  The sweet smell 
of decay fills the air, tainted by another fragrance that is subtle and 
rather pleasant.

The trees have a ghostly grey bark that contrasts starkly with the black 
thorny brush that is apparent nearly everywhere around this slight path, the 
effect of their colors and bleakness combining to make this strange wood 
seem dead.  The occasional howling sound reaches this desolate path through 
a dense fog that keeps everything else, including the sun, at bay.  Leaves 
move serenely over the surface of the stagnant pools found at the base of 
the trees, rotting even as they drift.  The path becomes muddier as it heads 
to the west, and steadily more stable to the south.

The path veers abruptly to almost double on itself here, managing to hide a 
monolithic black tree at the center of this grove until the last moment.  
The carcass of wood is at the dead center of the grove, surrounded by dark 
violet flowers that grow in abundance over the otherwise barren soil.  Black 
thorny brambles intertwine with the trees at the edges of this open space, 
their thickness looking rather unnegotiable.  The water that flows between 
the roots of the ghostly white trees decreases whatever desire is left to 
travel in those directions rather effectively.

This chamber is strangely illuminated with floating orbs of red magical

seem to have been fashioned for both pain and war hang next to sadistic
looking flails and the occasional mace.  Supple vines, spiky plants and
flexible reeds rest in bundles close to the counter, which has been grown
from the floor near to the southern wall the surface.  This counter holds
many different tools, some of which even appear to be fashioned from metal

The entirety of this glade seems to be new and fresh, almost as if it was
made this very morning, the colors are intense.  The air holds a pleasing
fragrance as well as a melody that seems to come from everywhere at once
without apparent sauce.  {RRed{x and {cblue{x blossoms grow in rows from the
narrowest point at northeast of this clearing towards the western end and
the surrounding forest.  A colossal mushroom grows here, its trunk decorated
with an archway pattern of runic symbols.  To the south and east movement is
prevented by the ancient forest while the clearing stretches away to the
north and west.

An Enchanted Mushroom~
From the inside, this structure bears little resemblence to a mushroom at
all.  The only thing faintly reminiscent of the fact that it is a fungi is
the smooth white walls in this oval chamber.  Toadstools that are just the
right size for seating a fae grow from the floor of the room, their white
spotted caps looking soft and inviting.  Some strange leafy plants have been
shaped to appear sylvan, to which some armor has been strapped for display. 
Tamed growths of orange mushrooms can be seen on the walls, their surfaces
used for shelving to display boots and smaller pieces of armor.

An Enchanted Mushroom~
A song and gentle tune fills the air of this area seemingly coming from
all around opposed to any single source or sources, accompanying this melody
are fragrances much akin to a carefully selected perfume.  Rising from the
earth here, is a gigantic mushroom its white stem bearing markings that look
like magical runes these form an archway that leads inside.  To the north
and east venerable trees stand tall contradicting the impression that this
clearing is fresh and some how new with their great ages.  To the south and
west this grove stretches away, decorated with {Rred{x and {cblue{x flowers of some
unknown type.

The Enchanted Forest~
The trail widens out here forming into an idyllic glade which is
encompassed by ancient looking trees of great size.  {cBlue{x and {Rred{x flowers of
an unheard of type have been vigilantly planted in lines that stretch off
towards the western edge of this dell, radiating from this point.  The air
is filled with agreeable music and the insubstantial bouquets of the flowers
producing an over all soothing effect, which is heightened by the strange
freshness of everything around you.  North and southwards giant mushrooms
can be seen while to the eastwards a trail stretches off and to the west a
mirror like lake is visible.

Butterflies~
All the colors of the {rr{ya{Yi{gn{bB{Mo{mw{x briefly swarms before you, then once more
settling about this off white chamber.  As the air stills you notices that
the color came from a profusion of butterflies that within this area, each
of them seemingly content to feast upon the nectar produced by the plants
lining this room.  A archway surrounded by runes is set into the northwards
wall, though which an idyllic dell can be seen and calming music heard.

Point And Hack~
The walls of this room form innumerable hooks upon which weapons have
been placed so as to best make use of the magical orbs of light that
illuminate them.  Spears and swords seem the most common of the weapons
though a couple of long knifes are in evidence.  A smell much akin to
lacquer fills the chambers air most likely coming from the glinting weaponry
that adorns this chamber.  An archway which has runes surrounding it stands
in the northern wall through which a serene looking clearing is visible.

Enchante'~
A soft, malleable substances makes the walls of this place of business
which displays its wears of artfully grown bushes that support garments,
upon closer inspection it would appear that in some cases these shrubs are
in fact growing the clothing.  Various garments for both a male or female
faerie seem to be on sale here, each with its own unique touches to make the
item personal.  To the south a runic archway can be seen leading out into
the glade.

Just off white forms the circumference of this chamber which has glowing
runes carved into its surface.  An archway set into the southern wall seems
to lead outside to what could be best described as a faerie dell.  This
chamber holds several glass cases each of which hold parts of an insect, the
most common being butterfly wings though other items can be seen such as
antenna and what appear to be eyes.  A clean smell fills this chamber, both
fresh and refreshing though it lacks any natural odors.

An Enchanted Mushroom~
Ancient trees stand to the north, east and west looking almost too alive
to be real as does almost everything else within this clearing.  An enormous
mushroom grows in this area with runic symbols crafted into the living flesh
of its stem in an archway pattern that seems to lead inside.  The air of
this grove is filled with a sense of peace which is supported by a gentle
melody that plays throughout the air as well as a pleasant odor of some kind
of blossom, over all this places seems strangely magical and otherworldly.

The Enchanted Forest~
Rows of {cblue{x and {Rred{x flowers run from the forest to the east in a
southwesterly direction ending at the narrowest point of this dell in that
direction.  Everything in this glen seems to possess a tranquil quality
which is supported by a gentle tune that drifts upon the air along with a
sweet aroma.  To the south a gleaming pool can be seen while to the north a
giant mushroom is visible surrounding the entire area are venerable looking
trees with massive gnarled boughs.

An Enchanted Pool~
The very air of this forest clearing seems to be full of life, everything
seems some how cleaner and more real than what is considered normal.  A {Bpool{x
of shimmering water sits here surrounded by a soft, springy bed of moss.  To
the east ancient trees stand tall and proud their gnarled branches
stretching over this pool through not a single leaf seems to have disturbed
its surface.  To the west the dell stretches away decorated with {Rred{x and
{cblue {xblossoms that stretch from the narrowest point out towards the widest
point this eastern edge.

An Enchanted Mushroom~
A mushroom of unparalleled proportions grows here on its stem are some
intricate runes which seem to form an archway leading inside the fungus. 
The air possesses an unusual quality as well as pleasant flowery scents and
sweet music.  Old looking trees grow to the south, west and east their
gnarled branches lifted high as if praising the far distance sky while the
lustrous flowers and grass carpet the earth with their own vibrant colors. 
Off to the north, at some distance, a iridescent pool can just be made out
through the grasses and flowers.

This idyllic clearing stretches away in all directions, everywhere ones
eye trails seems vibrant, the grass all but glows with life while the {cblue{x
and {Rred{x blossoms seem to shimmer.  To the north a serene pool can be
perceived through the lush grasses its surface possessing a mirror like
quality from this perspective.  To the west and south mushrooms of truly
gigantic proportions are visible while all around ancient trees flourish
seeming to thrive within this usual environment.  The air is filled with
both mellow music and insubstantial scents which seem to be all around
opposed to coming from any clear source.

An Enchanted Mushroom~
Engaging music and aromas fill the air here seemingly coming from all
around at once.  Everything possesses a freshness, almost as if this place
was only created this morning purely for you, though this impression is
dispelled somewhat by the obvious age of the gigantic trees that stand to
the south and west.  A mushroom that seems as big as a house grows before
you with an odd looking rune surrounded archway upon its stem.  To the north
and east this section of the glade stretches away with alien looking flowers
of {cblue{x and {Rred{x laying in lines towards the southeast.

An Enchanted Mushroom~
The brilliance of this area is surprising it is almost as if everything
is new, this illusion is contradicted by the obvious age of the mighty trees
that stand all around this clearing, close by to both the north and west.  A
giant mushroom stands here the stem of which bears what seems to be a rune
surrounded archway which leads inside.  {RRed{x and {cblue{x flowers radiate
outwards towards the northeast from here having been carefully planted so as
to produce a pleasing pattern.  The dell extends to the east and south from
here looking idyllic with pleasant fragrances and soft music filling the
air.

The pathway widens out here forming into a serene glade which is
surrounded by primal looking trees of great size.  {RRed{x and {cblue{x flowers of
an unknown type have been carefully planted in lines that stretch off
towards the eastern edge of this clearing, radiating from this point at a
northeastern direction.  The air is filled with pleasant music and the
delicate aromas of the flowers producing an over all relaxing effect, which
is heightened by the strange freshness of everything around you.  North and
southwards giant mushrooms can be seen while to the west a trail stretches
off and to the east a pool is close by.

The Enchanted Forest~
Everything seems clean and fresh here, the long green grass seems more
vibrant, and the sky more blue the very air seems like no one has ever
breathed it before.  All around stand trees that must be hundreds of years
old judging by their size though each looks very much alive.  Two paths
stretch away from this clearing one to the east and one to the west though
they appear to be mirror images of each other.  The air is filled with both
the scents of blossoms and music both possessing indescribable beauty.
