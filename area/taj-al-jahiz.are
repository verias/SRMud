a female courtier~
A female courtier flies elegantly around, socializing with everyone.
~
This elegant Jinn is absolutely beautiful, which comes easy to the
courtiers since they have never known a hard day in their lives.  Her long
flowing dress hovers just slightly off the ground as she flies around
talking to the other courtiers.  Pearls and other gemstones cascade down her
hair, as if held there magically.  Her hair itself is tied up is beautiful
curls, though length is not cut short through the curls.  Her very pale blue
skin is almost white, matching her eyes, and making the dark black eye
makeup and bright red lipstick stand out from her.

Taj-Al-Jahiz is an ancient town, formed on a strong magic that the first
Jahiz had tapped into.  He gave this power to his people, the Jinn, and with
it grew a mighty city.  Peace ruled over this city, as its great walls
were safely protected from the Jinns enemies, the Efreet, by strong magical
barriers.  This lasted for many hundreds of years.  The great city grew
more powerful and beautiful as time went on, and the Efreet saw this and
wanted all that wasn't theirs.  A great battle ensued from this jealousy,
and the city was decimated.  The few Jinn who remained, cast the Efreet
deep into the desert, binding them there through their magic.  Slowly, over
many years, and many new Jahiz leaders, the city grew to a high status again,
and it was decided that the magical barrier hiding their city would be cast
down, so they may make new allies against the Efreet.
 
This is the city of Taj-Al-Jahiz today.  This is the greatness of the Jinn.

Created from a smokeless fire, the Jinn were to be servants to all

make decisions for themselves to be right or wrong, good or evil, in the
world.  The Jinn are a magical people, highly intelligent and able to change
form.  Those that chose the path of goodness and purity, are still known
today as the Jinn, while those who wished to cause havoc in the world have
been termed the Efreet, and cast out into the vast desert near the Jinn's

parchment letters~
As old as the lands, and buried by time.  This place is one of knowledge,
of the times left behind.  Never to be forgotten, yet never to be known. 
This places serves as a reminder of what happened long ago.  
 
Deep in this place, hidden in a room. There lies another parchment, much
like the one you now hold. This one serves as a riddle, though the answer
is a clue. Of where to go looking, to find it, should you choose.
 
Here is the riddle, now prepare your mind for it. For the answer is
complicated and it is sure to worry your wit.
 
Shrouded in darkness, protected by force. The creatures who guard this place
do so with a ferocity to protect their home and their art.  Their art is of
stealth and disregard for life. They use this art to defend against outsiders,
who might come to take their wealth.
 
Their place is covered in buildings, each in stages of disrepair. Mostly this
is due to the water which is everywhere.  Some places it is shallow, in others
its very deep. Yet the entire place is a reminder of the horrors of what man
can do to man. Greed, hate, and distrust all led to the downfall of this place,
and now it serves as a memory of times past and our mistakes.
 
Go here if you can find it, if you dare to enter the gates. Search for a place of
power, and speak to the one at the throne. He will have the remainder of this puzzle,
held in his very hands. I warn you now the path will not be easy. In fact it will be
deadly, and dangerous therein.

Outside the Gates of Taj-Al-Jahiz~
The great stone walls seen from a distance previously have loomed upon
you.  A dark oak gate stands blocking your path into the castle to the
south.  On either side of the gate are tall towers, at the top of which are
lookouts.  Looking east and west the stone wall continues, ending at each
corner with more lookouts, at the top of which can be seen a small face
peeking out.

Inside Taj-Al-Jahiz~
Sound erupts after passing through the gates as a large market place
spreads out before you.  People are hustling about doing their daily chores,
and mixed in with them are small animals that wander about.  Directly in the
middle of the market are gallows, and beyond this can be seen the large
stone castle.  All around making winding paths through the town are small
tents and huts scattered about without any thought.  Directly to the east
and west are small gatehouses with wooden ladders in them.

The windows are brightly coloured, filtering the light entering the store
into many vibrant colours.  A slight haze fills the room from the smoke of
potions on the hearth and incense burning along the shelves.  The smells of
spices and exotic things fill ones nose, almost making one want to sneeze. 
The doorways are draped with coloured glass beads and clear crystals which
refract the light hitting them.  A flimsy tables spans the length of the
room, cutting it in two parts - one for the customer and one for the gypsy
and the wares she sells.  Lined up along the table are all sorts of crystals
and bottles and silver jewelry.

Large wooden gallows stand before you, looking like they were here before

looking.  Many people must have been hung from this spot over the years, and
by the looks of how the people don't even seem to notice it, hangings are a
common occurrence in this castle.  Blood stained ropes dangle loosely from
the wooden beams, swaying slightly as though ghosts were swinging them back

necessities on.  Most of these nails are used for rope, hand-woven blankets
and horseshoes.  The hard ground is covered with a thick layer of hay,
partly to cover a messy floor, partly to cover the smell of manure and
partly to soften the ground for the horses.  Lanterns hanging from the
ceiling cast dim light circles on the ground around you.  You can see the

Surrounding you are many wooden stalls.  Only three of these stalls are

lazy eyes.  The first is a small gray pony who bobs his head knowingly at
you.  The other is a pure white horse, who looks wild as it shakes its head,
its mane flying around like fire.  The eastern wall houses only one horse -
a massive Clydesdale that looks down at you with big brown eyes.  At the
very northern part of the stalls is a wide table that is piled high with
various types and sizes of saddles.

gallows nearby.  Leading off the road to the north is a short dirt path
ending at a large wooden cart who's owner stands nearby.  A warm, wonderful
smell wafts over the air to you from the south, and looking that direction
you can see steps leading up into the open doors of a bakery.  More hustle

The road leads perfectly north-south here, and has no stores or buildings
leading off it.  To the west is the tall stone wall protecting the town and
castle from the wilds outside the walls.  The large stone blocks are
darkened and aged with years of weathering.  Lining the east side of the
road is a rough wooden fence standing about six feet.  Spaces between the
boards let you peek through to see a large wooden cart filled to the top
with fruit.

Bed & Breakfast~
This large room doesn't quite give you the cozy, comfort feeling of a
"Bed & Breakfast", but more of an elegant, expensive air.  Set against the
northern wall is a mahogany desk which is kept nicely polished, behind which
is a few nooks in the wall to hold any mail for customers.  Centred in the
room on a circular rug is a small round table.  Adorning the table is a
large crystal vase with a fresh bouquet of flowers.  Lining the western and
eastern walls are large couches, which spill over into the next room to the
south which appears to be a dining room.

West Sapyr Road~
The cobblestone road comes to a blinding halt to the north at a dark
stone wall that surrounds the town.  Despite the semi-rough conditions along
this road, this tiny corner is kept meticulously clean and swept.  Looking
up, you can see the battlements along the top of the wall, and to the west
is the tall tower where archers would do battle.  A rough wooden door to the
west shows the way into this tower, and otherwise the only way to go is
south.

The Northwest Tower~
The thick stone walls have a tiny window next to the heavy oak door to
the east that is the only source of natural light in this dark room.  The
place is sparsely furnished with a small wood table and two chairs.  On the
table is an unlit oil lantern.  Tucked back in the south-western corner is a
hay-filled mattress on the floor.  The mattress looks as though rats have
been using it more than humans.  A rickety wooden ladder leads vertically up
to the ceiling where a hatch is located to go up a floor.

Bed & Breakfast~
Four small round tables each surrounded by four wooden chairs fill most
of the space in this room.  Each table is decorated with a fresh vase of
flowers.  Large windows in the eastern and western walls make sure there's
constantly light entering the room, whether it's daylight, or light from the
town and stars at night.  In the back corner of the room is a steep narrow
stairway leading up to where the rooms would be rented out, but a barrier
has been placed in front of it for some unknown reason.  The southern wall
is almost completely filled with a bar, but there is space enough for a
small door next to it.

Bed & Breakfast Bedroom~
This tiny back room has been converted into a small bedroom for the
less-important customers the inn has.  A small window in the eastern wall is
framed by lace curtains and looks out into the town.  Below the window is a
tiny dresser to hold what few possessions the inhabitant might have on them.
In the back south-western corner is tucked away a tiny cot, with barely
enough room for a man to lay down.  In the centre of the room is a circular
rag-rug, which has been dulled and muted by years of use.  Despite all this,
there is a feeling of charm and quaintness, and you feel welcome to rest
yourself for a while here.  The door leading out into the rest of the Bed
and Breakfast is in the northern wall.

The road comes to an abrupt halt to the west, as it meets up with a wall
holding a small window with lace curtains.  It continues to the south,
leading to a darker part of the town, though you are sure there must be
stores down there.  A wooden door is propped open to the north, welcoming
customers in.  Above the door is a large shoe, indicating that the store
below it is a shoe store.  The cobblestones lead to the east where more
stores are located as well as to the south.

Fancy Feet~
The smell of leather and glue fills the room, along with the sound of
tapping from hammering nails into the soles of shoes fills the air.  Lined
up neatly on tables and shelves are many brown and black leather shoes and
boots.  A large pair of sharp scissors sit open on the table next to a
tipped jar of small nails that have spilt over onto the floor.  Though the
finished shoes may be kept neat, the shoes in progress are all over the
room, pieces everywhere and leather snippings dotting the floor.

West Emerand Road~
The road leads you north and south from here, with the north being more
lit and seemingly cheerier than the south part looks.  Along the eastern
edge of the road is a tall building, casting shadows over the road.  There
aren't any windows to look in and see what the building is for though.  On
the western edge of the road are some wooden stairs leading up to a heavy
door with the picture of a pig on it.  Framing the door are shuttered
windows, as though the people inside are trying to keep things out.

The clean cobblestone road that runs in an east-west direction here,

to the south.  On the northern side of the road is the back of a store which
must front on a road to the north that runs parallel to this one.  A locked
door and shuttered windows are all that you can see on this building to
north, giving no way in.  The sound of tinkling bells draws your attention

This tiny store manages to keep itself cool even though its windows and
door is kept shut to keep insects out.  Hanging in the back of the store are
huge slabs of meat, ready to be cut for your desire.  On a long string
running over a butchers table are various types of sausages, looped in a
spiral.  Blood stains the floor everywhere, though some patches look fresh
and bright.  Stuck in a heavy piece of wood attached to the wall behind the
table are a row of sharp mirror-like knives.

In a constant shadow, this part of West Emerand Road has a rougher feel
than the rest of the road.  The cobblestones are still neatly laid and kept
clean, running north and south here.  A rough wooden building butts up
against the road to the west here, though no windows allow you to see what
it could possibly be.  Along the eastern side of the road is a high stone
wall, enclosing the royal castle grounds.

Dead End~
The road ends abruptly here, collecting leaves and other small pieces of
litter.  This back corner barely sees the light of day from the surrounding
walls and buildings, so it is forgotten about by the residents of town.  A
wooden fence along the western side of the road is in shambles, though
miraculously is still standing.  A loose board looks as though it can be
moved out of the way however, and behind it is gaping darkness.

This dark alley has been hidden from the rest of the town for good

their noses twitching in your direction.  Loud shouts and laughter spill
from a decrepit building to the north.  Light shines through the many cracks
in the door and boarded windows, and through the shadows a figure can be
seen sitting near the entrance.  A loose board to the east looks like it
could be moved out of the way for you to go through.

Dark and dirty, the people who frequent this tavern reflect its interior
perfectly.  Loud laughter and shouting fills the small room as the bar
wenches try to make their way through the crowds as best as possible.  Sharp
knives and daggers can be seen glinting in the dim lighting either on the
tables or in the hands of the rogues and misfits.  Ale flows freely here,
giving the shine to the bar top which reflects the scared face of the
bartender glaring at you.  A loud smash of breaking glass from behind you
exemplifies the unease and tension in the air.

open to the north, welcoming all who pass by.  The only indication as to
what the store to the north would be, is the strange little symbol painted
in a bright yellow between the open doorway and the draperied window.  The
south is fenced off with a large black wrought iron fence that keeps the
beautiful gardens behind it protected from the commoners of the town. 
Neatly arranged cobblestones lead you east and west along the road.

Strange and wonderful aromas circle about you in different coloured
hazes.  Brightly coloured bottles line the walls between thick old books and
strange glowing crystals.  Thick coloured rugs lay atop each other in a
haphazard way, carpeting the floor piece by piece.  A small table sits in
the middle of the room, and in the middle of the table is a large crystal
ball.  Looking at the crystal ball, you see a purple mist swirling inside
it, drawing you deeper and deeper in...

offers a happy greeting.  To the south, a large glistening white castle

atop a short flight of steps.  Above these grand doors is a carved marble
sign stating that this building is the "Taj-Al-Jahiz University".  The road

marble floor is inlaid with beautiful flower designs in a circle around the
kiosk in the centre of the room.  The wood of the kiosk glows with a warm
shine and holds a few precious books and vases with flowers for decorations.
Pictures of important people in the castle's history are framed in heavy
gilt carved frames and hung around the room.  Light comes down from above
through a large skylight in the ceiling.

attention to the sign that always seems in perpetual motion to the south.

pale blue and silver silk dress with strands of pearls around her neck,
while the male is dressed in a dark blue form-fitting suit with a white
carnation.  The richness of the material and the way the models are dressed
gives the air that this store is only for those of the wealthy towns people.

The road takes a sharp bend here, now leading to the west and south.  You
can follow the cobblestones in either of those directions to see more of the
castle grounds, or you can go into the shops to the north or east.  Looking
east, the wind catches the scent of flowers and brings it to you, filling
your senses with the fragrance.  This is a good indication that flowers can
be bought from the store to the north, and the sign of "Lindara's Flowers"
confirms this.  The store front to the east doesn't give much away about it,
as the only indication that it is a store is the fact that the door is open
and a large star is painted next to it.

The Southwest Tower~
The thick stone walls have a tiny window placed centred in the eastern
wall, that is the only source of natural light in this dark room.  The place
is sparsely furnished with a small wood table and two chairs.  On the table
is an unlit oil lantern.  Tucked back in the south-western corner is a
hay-filled mattress on the floor.  The mattress looks as though rats have
been using it more than humans.  A rickety wooden ladder leads vertically up
to the ceiling where a hatch is located to go up a floor, and another hatch
is in the floor beneath the table.

The Grand Entryway~
The size of this room hits you like the cool breeze that seems to come
from all around.  Large blocks of sparkling stone have been worn to a smooth
polish by many years of use and scrubbing the floors.  Huge tapestries hang
from the walls depicting mystical landscapes and beautiful people.  These
deeply coloured woven master-pieces are light by torches placed between them
on the walls.  Tall, thin and deeply set windows overlook the garden pools
to the north, framing the dark polished wood doors that lead back into the
town.  South of this position is a large arch that leads into a dimly lit
cavernous room.

The Main Room~
The cavernous size of this room is almost overwhelming.  Looking up, you
can only see shadows shrouding the vaulted ceiling, light barely able to
reach into the depths.  The floor is the same sparkling dark stone that has
been worn smooth over centuries.  Any small sound you make echoes
dramatically from the walls and ceiling.  East and west of this spot in the
large room are smaller, though still large, nooks for various purposes -
east appears to be a dining area and west looks empty.  A bright red carpet
starts suddenly and leads to a throne to the south.

An immense candelabra hangs low from the tall ceiling to light a long
heavy wood table.  One tall, thing window looks out over the east to catch
the morning sun.  The walls are covered with large paintings and tapestries
depicting the glory days of the royal family here.  In one corner stands a
large globe, showing a world unknown to anyone of this land.  The table
spreads out, filling the majority of the space here, with twelve chairs
tucked in neatly around it.  There is a strange block of stone set in the
wall that doesn't look like an original piece of the stonework.

Empty Nook~
Almost totally devoid of anything in this space, the floor here is much
more smooth and formed than anywhere else.  Dust now collects in corners
where people used to stand, filling the castle with chatter and laughter.  A
tall, narrow window is placed centred in the western wall, paralleling
another window in the nook far off to the east.  Also mimicking the nook to
the east is a large candelabra hanging low from the shadowed ceiling. 
Looking closer at the floor, you can see what looks like a long string from
some type of instrument.

Throne Room~
The room here seems to glow with its own light, shining down onto the
majestic throne seated in the centre back against the wall.  Above the
throne is a large painting of a beautiful young woman wearing a heavy
diamond crown.  A gold plaque is attached to the frame at the bottom and
tells you the woman is Awenyedd.  To the east and west of the throne and
painting are small, dark alcoves that don't seem to lead anywhere.

beauty is absolutely breath-taking.

The Castle Tower~
This large landing is the first floor up in a tall tower that soars over
the land surrounding the castle.  Many small, coloured and plain windows dot
the southern and eastern walls, giving a good view of the countryside
surrounding the town.  The hall continues to the north and west, leading off
to closed doors.  The walls are bare and there are no furnishings.  Light
comes from stubby candles that are attached to the walls, spaced enough to
not have any dark areas, but far enough apart that it's not extremely
bright.  A patch of carpet seems to be a slightly different shade than the
rest of the carpet in this area.

This small branch of the hallway seems to be a collect-all area for
whoever lives here.  A large shelf is filled with books and crystals and
strange contraptions that have no visible means for a use.  A single candle
is affixed to the southern wall here, giving strong shadows that dance over
the floor and shelf.  Along the eastern wall, and rickety old ladder leads
straight up to the ceiling with no visible signs of something holding it
here.  On the floor directly below the ladder is a small red rug that has
been so worn in the centre that the colour is now an off-white.

This dark and closed-in room has a strange magical air to it.  A small
table lining the southern wall is filled with strange glass apparatus filled
with colourful solutions.  Books and manuscripts are scattered about the
room and practically fall from a bookshelf on the northern wall.  Strange
skulls and stones fill up all the rest of the open spaces to hold things off
the floor.  Dust and cobwebs fill the corners of the room, though the main
open floor is clean, showing this room is still used today.  Placed centred
in the western wall is an ancient wooden ladder.

Awenyedd's Chamber~
Dark and damp, this room causes shivers to run over your spine.  High
above your head are a few narrow breaks in the stone wall, giving a small
amount of ventilation and murky light to the room.  You can hear the cooing
of pigeons up in the darkness of the rafters above the narrow slits of
light.  The smell of moulding straw is rancid in the air while the sound of
trickling water invades your ears.  You can hear a soft whimpering coming
from somewhere, though you can't pinpoint it exactly because of the echoes
this round chamber amplifies.

window, you can over look the entire town and see the many citizens moving
around, doing their daily tasks.  Beyond the strong walls surrounding the
town, you can see the forests and fields that are still wild.  The little
table below the window holds a candle to light this end of the hall and a
small bowl with a little gold fish swimming in it.  A large cherry wood door
fills the western wall, making the eastern wall look even more plain.  The
hall continues to the south.

A Large Bedroom~
This room is almost the size of a commoner's house, and this is just a
bedroom.  Large bay windows fill the north, west and southern walls, partly
covered by heavy dark blue velvet drapes.  The brightness from the cracks of
light at the windows is a stark contrast to the dark colours decorating the
rest of the room.  Polished dark red wood boards lay in a direction to lead
ones eyes to the bed below the window to the north.  Hanging from the
ceiling is a fancy wrought iron candelabra filled with half-burned candles. 
A large door the colour of the floor takes up just a small fraction of the
eastern wall, the rest of it being filled with a mirror and tapestries
framing a large stone fireplace.  Small tables and chests fill most of the
border of the room, and a little vanity station is placed discretely by a
large wardrobe in the south-western corner of the room.  The smell of a
strange incense swirls about the room, though you can't pinpoint the
location it's coming from.

Stone Stairs~
The stairs here are narrow, barely giving you enough room to get by, as
if you step slightly to one side or the other, you brush up against cold,
slimy stone walls.  Darkness invades your eyes, not letting you see more
than one step ahead or behind you.  Echoing through the hall are faint moans
and groans of people in extreme pain.  The sharp crack of a whip and a loud
scream curdles ones blood, making one cautious about continuing down into
the dark depths.

Torches spot the slick stone walls, casting dim and eerie light over the
rough walls and dirt-packed floor.  Heavy thick chains and shackles line the
walls, while corners are filled with various standing torture devices.  The
pungent stench of death and decay fills ones nostrils sharply.  Painful
moaning and groaning fills your ears from all around you, from the prisoners
chained to the walls for punishment.  A large room which emanates heat and
sweat and pain opens up to the south, while a dark hallways leads off to the
west.  Slick rough stone stairs lead back up into darkness.

This long hallway is dotted with torches alternating walls to get the
maximum amount of light for the minimum amount of torches.  Immediately to
the north is a heavy wooden door, studded with metal spikes that look
rusted, though not quite the colour rust usually is.  Packed dirt leads you
east and west through the cold stone walls.  A tiny whimpering can be heard
echoing up and down the hallway, as is a loud cracking whip which is enough
to make anyone jump.

The stone hallway ends suddenly at a ladder to the west here.  Looking
down, you can see the floor has recently been swept here, and there are no
stains and scuffs in the hard dirt.  Brighter light fills this corner than
the rest of the hall to the east, making this part feel slightly out of
place down in these dark depths.  The large stones making the walls to
either side of you have been slightly smoothed down, and no signs of
deterioration can be seen.

This stinking pit of a room sucks in any who are unfortunate enough to be
forced in here.  Cold stone walls are covered in a strange slime, that upon
closer inspection is reddish, making the walls look like they are bleeding. 
A loud whistling can be heard, like wind rushing through an opening in the
stones, though total blackness indicates this is impossible.  The faint
light you bring into this room makes the floor look like black skeletal
hands reaching up to grab you in desperation to free themselves or bring you
down with them - or is that not tricks of light, but actually happening?

This large room is filled with various torturing devices, cages and pits
where a strange howling comes from.  Many torches on the walls cast
flickering lights over the people here, and make the strange shadows on the
walls dance around you.  Those prisoners that are conscious, look at you
woefully, their eyes begging you to free them from this hell.  The looks
some of the prison guards cast over to you as they loudly whip their
prisoner, is enough to give even the most hardened of people shivers down
their spine.

stone walls are dark black with age and rough, though a single trail of
bright green algae glistens in the torch light signifying where water is
continually leaking through the wall.  The large torture room opens up to
the west, with the groans of the many prisoners resonating down this small
hallway to you.

single item - the iron maiden.  Only one barely-lit torch casts any kind of

pooling out from the iron maiden itself.

The lighting in this small nook off the larger room to the north is

crumbled, leaving a pile of broken rock and dirt, which now fills most of
the space.  Poking out from beneath this mound, you can see some dirty, torn
material, and by looking closer, the dirt-covered whiteness of bone. 
Hanging just to the side of the broken part of the wall is a rusted chain
ending in a shackle that still has part of a decomposing arm attached to it.

road are buildings with boarded up windows and large cracks running through
the brick.  Beyond the houses to the east, you can make out the high stone
walls protecting the city from the dangers of the wilds outside.  Off in the
distance to the north-east is a tall tower which overlooks the world outside

Outside the Royal Guard Barracks~
East Emerand Road stops suddenly here at the doors to the Royal Guard
Barracks.  The cobblestones lead to the north as they only way out of this
cul-de-sac, otherwise to the south is the heavy door to the barracks.  No
windows adorn this building from this view, and it is in typical simple
military style.  The location for the barracks seems out of the way, though
it is close to the castle, perhaps with some secret passage between the two,
and also close to the stable to the north.  Either side of the road here is
closed off with high stone walls, the western one being part of the castle,
and the eastern one being part of the battlements.
