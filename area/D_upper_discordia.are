A town crier is here, advertising the shops of Discordia. ({CLOOK CRIER{x).

A young boy is here crying out that you can find {cGreck's Armoury{x and {cTrade 
Your Blade{x to the east.  He is rather well kempt for his age, which seems to 
be approximately eleven years.  His clothes are clean and neat but obviously 
lacking refinement, looking to be homespun by a caring mother.  His brown 
hair is messy and sticks up no matter how many times he tries to smooth it 
down to appear more presentable.

sneaking thief figure~
the thief~
A hooded figure dressed in black skulks nearby.
~
By all appearances, the hooded figure seems very skilled in the ways of
subterfuge. As you watch the figure skulk nearby, you hear nary a sound as it
becomes quite apparent that if you hadn't luckily caught a glimpse of it,
you probably would still be oblivious to its presence. The thief is dressed
from head to toe in black and from all it appearances and cat-like stealth,
it would probably make a formidable opponent.

ridiculed mercilessly he threw off his sub-issue armor and stayed to tend
bar.

almond eyes. Grease glistens on his sweaty face as he labors over the grill.
He looks up at you as he notices you and says, "Get out! Get out of my
kitchen now! No customers allowed." He stares at you blandly and waits for
you to leave.

Master Chan wears a long white robe, which looks more in the style of a
toga than anything else.  Attached at his waist is a golden cord, from which
hangs a small bottle.  He looks old and frail, though in extremely good

a crippled mystic~
A crippled old man is kneeling nearby, tossing bloody chicken bones.
~
When you look down at this old man, he peers up at you with a toothless
grin.  You notice one eye is covered by a thick white membrane while the
other is large and dilated.  Beneath the torn rags he uses for clothing, you
can make out old, faded tattoos of mystic symbols.  His left leg ends at a
bound stump just above where is ankle would have been.  You notice that his
hands are caked with the dried blood of the chicken bones he is tossing.

Myang Chan~
A well built man of undoubtedly noble heritage carefreely saunters about.
~
The one and only son of Master Huan Tse Chan, Myang could rightfully be
considered as a pride to his family.  The relatively young man offers
somewhat of a short height, but nevertheless a stern build.  His finely
trimmed hair is tinged a dark black, outlining a delicately featured, kind
and elegant face of a man at peace.  A certain tranquility can be seen
within his dark brown eyes, as well as his overall demeanor, whether it is
gestures, words or whatnot.  Myang's Chan appearence clearly speaks of a man
trained both at the mental and physical arts, one to be reckoned with.

armor~
The armor is in good condition, polished and oiled, so it can be used at
any time.  Its weight is balanced evenly on a small platform, though it
looks like any small nudge of it will knock the suit down with a loud
clatter.  Leaning gently against the side of the leg, close to the hand, is
a highly polished and sharp sword.

The Shrine of Discordia~
An unnatural stillness fills the air, aiding to evoke a sense of serenity
and well-being.  Eight snowy pillars stand as sentinels within this
cavernous {cdome{x, one rising in each of the major compass points. 
Moonflower vines spiral up each column and lend their alluring scent to the
chamber.  Light grey marble, flecked with ruby red and emerald green mingled
with black onyx accents diffuse the light and make the shadows in the
recesses of the room indistinct.  A {cpedestal{x rises from the shimmering
pool that is located in the middle of this inspiring place, seeming to be
the focal point of this area.  Something is glinting from atop the
{cpedestal{x and faint markings quite like writing can be seen upon its

Guild of Divine Healing Rotunda~
It was impossible to truly comprehend the sheer vastness of this room
until finally entering into it.  The various riches and plush seating
arrangements adorn this amazing expanse, and all sorts of amazing treasures
can be seen as you glance about in awe.  Adventurers come from all over the
land to meet and talk with other healers here.  It's even rumored that there
is a secret room where higher level healers go, but no one speaks of it for
fear of the curse.

It is said that if the god of healing were to hear of anyone giving away

around themselves, and not try to gain all new knowledge by querying others.

You walk into the foyer of the healer's guild and you can feel the
radiance of healing energy flowing from inside.  All types of healers come
from miles around to gather and share secrets with one another, from the
most experienced to the newest apprentice.  However, only those who chose to
use the true powers of their gods to correct harm are allowed in here.  As
you peer into the room, you gaze upon such luxuries as you have not seen the
likes of before, and you know those inside do not want for much.

enjoy the splendid view while hopefully catching dinner. The East Discordia
River, with its steep banks and rocky shallows, is quite difficult for
boaters, but excellent for fishing. Over the buildings to the north, you
can see majestic snow-tipped peaks rising above the twin river valley.

inn's second floor. To the south is a rustic almost fortress like building.
You can hear the clash of steel on steel through the iron banded doors 
framing the open entryway. Hanging above this is a sign proclaiming it as

hall with twinkling luminescence that causes shadows to play across the
walls. The cold feeling of a presence can be felt emanating from the walls,

wave of dizziness washes over you, causing your vision to blur and your
head to throb. When you finally manage to clear the cobwebs from your brain,
you find yourself in the same exact anteroom, however this time it is not
empty. A well stocked bar, complete with a wide assortment of liquors, can
be seen filling the entire southern wall. The din of conversation and laughter
fills the air, only interrupted by the occasional flash and thunderclap of
a pyrotechnic spell. The only empty seats you can see are at the bar itself.

This is the Magical Experiments Laboratory where all the spellcasters of
Discordia come to practice their skills and to renew their bindings with the
magical weave.  Dark smoke-stained and slightly charred stones arch over
numerous huge oaken tables, most of which are cluttered with strange looking
pipes, flasks, and liquid separators.  The floor is covered with mystic
symbols and half-erased pentagrams along with other unknown runes, some
still faintly glowing with power.  A large blackboard in the corner of the
far wall can be barely made out in the shadows.  It has only been partially
cleaned, and in fact the few remaining symbols almost sear your eyes.  A

is a heavy wooden sort with a large iron ring as a handle to pull it shut. 
It fits snuggly in the frame when closed but is usually left ajar.  The

The Secret Yard~
Stealth, swiftness and secrecy are but a handful of the threads that,
entwined, conceive the Art of Thievery.  Together the thieves are as one,
and the guild is a place of camaraderie and learning the art.  Practice
dummies have been set out for sparring purpose.  Stones have been pulled a
random distance out from walls for climbing.  Here members strive to master
the arts of their chosen, darker path.

Bedroom~

view.  This bedroom, once respectable enough to sleep in is now filled with
bad memories and lowly crimes.  The walls are stained with ale and foolish
men's illusions.  This room is clearly one frequently used for unlawful acts
of abuse.  No upstanding citizen of Discordia would be seen here.  The only
exit is back down, into the tavern.

The Art of War Bar~
Heavy wooden tables are placed randomly about the room here.  It is quite
loud, rowdy adventurers let down their guards here.  Combat is not allowed
and only the most foolish warrior would attempt it here.  The ale flows
freely here and singing is routinely heard.  Along the north wall are large
iron hooks on which adventurer's hang their heavier weapons.  To the east is
a long bar behind which sits a rather portly man.  To the south is a warm
hearth, remarkable in it's size, around which a group of adventurers is
huddled.

The Meditation Chamber~
Waves of calmness and serenity wash over you as you enter this domed room.
The walls are cut from solid slabs of clear quartz and provide a splendid
view of the surrounding town and countryside. Unlike the rest of the tower,
no light sources are evident here. It is apparent that whoever constructed
this chamber preferred the natural illumination of the sun and stars. You
notice a faint resonance filling the air, reverberating off the walls and
filling the room with magical energy. You feel completely at one with your 
body and mind. You notice several down pillows scattered about the floor
to provide cushioning to those who wish to meditate here. A spiral
staircase leads down into the tower from here.

leading into the building.  A large sign, polished to a sheen, proudly
proclaims this building as the Adventurer's Guild.  Rumor has it that the

many hard days and nights of heroism.  You can return to Guildsman Row to

scent of foreign spices intermingled with the strong aroma of finely brewed
ale.  Although the bar is quite busy, several open booths can be seen
towards the back in the shadows.  You can leave the bar through the northern
archway which leads to the entryway or by passing through a bead covered
doorway to the south.  As you consider your options, you hear a loud grunt
of pain followed by a flurry of clashing such as two swords would make when

{CCast Into Oblivion{x~
You awaken to find yourself floating in an endless void. You are consumed
in darkness and your body feels numb and is totally unresponsive to your
commands. After what seems to be an eternity, a strong, cold breeze blows
across your body. Tremors of pain and tingling wrack your senses as you slowly
regain feeling and control of your body. Eventually the pain subsides and you
notice a bright {Wlight{x below you. As you watch, you notice the light growing
larger and brighter. After seconds of contemplating on what to do, you
realize that its not the light approaching you. It seems as if the cool
breeze has been blowing you towards the light all along. Just when that
thought crosses your mind for contemplation, the breeze increases in
intensity, becoming a strongly blowing gale. As you drift towards the light,
you feel a powerful presence beckon you towards the light, almost as if it
wants you to enter it.

and seem to try and draw the attention of any onlookers.  Above you, hanging
proudly on the wall, is the humongous stuffed head of an ancient golden
dragon.  It seems to look out upon the foyer with a mixture of sorrow and
humility in its eyes.  Hauntingly beautiful music filters in through the
archway to the north, lifting your spirits and making you wonder how the

the light from the cozy stone fireplace set within the northern wall. Hushed
whispers can be heard over the music from the numerous patrons inhabiting
the aged pine tables scattered about the room, almost reverent in their
volumes. To the right of the fireplace is a slightly raised dias used to
ensure that all of the patrons will have an excellent view of the
entertainment. To the left of the fireplace, a worn spiral staircase can
be seen leading up into the inn proper. To the east, through a swinging
door, you detect the faint sounds of banging pots. You can return to the
foyer through an entryway to the south.

polished brass lanterns and metal work on the smooth walls of this grand
foyer.  Light gently cascades down, illuminating the expertly tiled mosaic
on the floor.  You can see the edge of a plush azure carpet through an
archway to the north while a set of double doors lead to the busy street to
the south.

A beautiful golden dragon entwined around a large curving sword adorns

long and snake like and completely without wings.

A finely furnished living room~
Plush {cazure{x carpet of exquisite craftsmanship covers the hardwood
floor of this large living chamber.  Brass lanterns adorn the stained
{Rcherry{x and onyx framed walls creating an atmosphere of luxury and
wealth.  Sofas and chairs of thick, comfortable looking down are
meticulously arranged around a glowing brass fireplace in the northeastern
corner of the room.  A large portrait of an aged man covers the wall
immediately over the hearth.  Adorning the other walls are framed scrolls
with unrecognizable symbols painted upon their surfaces in a myriad of
bright colors.  Exits lead in all directions.

The Banquet Hall~
A large room opens before you, and any movement you make echoes off the
walls and floor.  The luxury of the room is seen in the hardwood floor,
unmarred in any way, and two large candelabras hang from the ceiling over
the long table.  Three large windows line the eastern wall, spaced evenly
apart and running from floor to ceiling.  Sheer white curtains hang loosely
and pool on the floor as they do little more than add to the decor of the
room.  In between the windows are two pictures, one of a young man who faces
to the middle window and the other of a young woman who faces from the other
direction to the middle window.  The southern wall is filled mostly with a
large fireplace, the mantle being taller than a normal man.

pictures~
The young man in the picture vaguely resembles the pictures of the old

other picture is extremely beautiful, though she looks rather frail.

A Large Kitchen~
The room contrasts sharply with the other lavish rooms in the house, as
it's filled with the highest technology and stainless steel appliances.  The
ceramic tiled floor helps keep the room slightly cooler, though when the
large oven is on, it makes little difference.  In the far corner is a large
stainless steel refrigerator, next to which is a double sink below a window.
Filling the middle of the room is a heavy wood counter with pots hanging
over hand and drawers all around the edge, one of which is slightly open,
showing silver flashing inside.

The room shines with a gold light, from the natural light of the room
reflecting off many trophies and plaques set on shelves and hung on the
walls.  The floor is covered with a dark red oriental rug, and centred in
the room is a circular sofa, so all the treasures can be seen from any angle
comfortably.  A large window opens in the west wall, and below this is a
small table.

The Narrow Hallway~
Deep golden hardwood floor peeks out from between dark scarlet rugs
spread evenly down the hall.  The rugs are speckled with a delicate cherry
blossom design, and fringed in gold.  Eggshell coloured walls remain mostly
bare, leaving clean lines for the length of the hall, though three frosted
conical lights are spaced evenly along the eastern wall.  Just before the
western exit, a dark cherry wood cabinet sits low to the floor.  An
identical cabinet is set just past the west exit, though along the eastern
wall.  On both are frosted vases, overflowing with cherry tree branches in
full blossom.

Large stones make the walls of this rounded room.  A black steel spiral
staircase goes up into darkness.  Small slits of windows follow the winding
path up to another level.  Each window splashes bright colours onto the
black steel from the amazing stained glass patterns set in them.  A
high-pitched whistling can be heard coming from the drafts in this room
moving through the grating of the staircase.

The Dojo~
Light fills the room from all directions but east from illuminated rice
paper walls.  Strong wooden beams can be seen supporting the
bamboo-decorated roof through the rice paper, and the golden wood from the
hallway covers the entire floor.  The high polish on the floor reflects back
the light from the walls, and makes it look like there is a thin layer of
still water covering the wood.  Hanging from a few of the beams are
intricately carved swords, the metal blades contrasting with the delicate
ivory grips.  To the right of the eastern door is a small black and white
picture of the same elderly man seen in other pictures in this house.

E
picture~
In a simple black wooden frame is a black and white photograph of an
elegant man, the same seen in previous rooms.  His brow shows his
aristocracy and strength, though a small smile crosses his lips showing his
compassion.  This picture being hung as the only object on this one wall
places it in high importance, indicating that this picture has been watched
and admired by many students who pass through this Dojo.  
~
E
beams~
A long wooden pole rests lightly against the paper walls, it's high
polish matching that of the floor.  Hanging from a beam to the left of the
bow is a large elaborate Samari sword, its delicate ivory handle attached to
a strong metal blade.  Folded neatly in the corner is some silk, as dark as
night, and as soft looking as a kittens fur.

The Rocky Pool~
Stepping from the dojo to the south, you find yourself surrounded by
water on a small bamboo dock.  The pool itself is raised above the
landscape, held in place by many large boulders and rocks.  In the distance,
a small bubbling of water can be heard, and you can see the water cascading
over a pink rock into the landscape below.  Hanging from the roof of the
dojo are bamboo wind chimes that bring a calming sound that echoes back and
forth between trees.  Brightly coloured flowers peek out from between rocks,
and green ferns reach to look at their reflection in the still water. 
Floating slowly along the surface of the water are pale yellow and pink
lilies that perch themselves on their dark green lily pads.  The water is
extremely clear, and looking down you can see right to the rounded stones
below.

Clear water lets you see the stones lining the base of the pond.  Small

the water near you.

The Artsy Landing~
The same eggshell white walls are just barely visible here, as the walls
are mostly covered with various sized paintings.  All sorts of genres of art
are mixed in with each other.  The bright paintings of a more abstract style
almost clash with the dark tones of baroque pieces, though standing from a
distance makes them look beautiful together, instead of as separate pieces. 
Only one large area is left uncovered by art, and that's the large picture
window set in the northern wall.

The Enormous Bedroom~
The stark bareness of this room contrasts sharply with the clutter of the
hallway.  It seems as though the owner of this house loves art, though likes
bareness in his rooms as well.  A thick plush carpet of a neutral beige
keeps all noises in here to a whisper, and only a large wardrobe, bed, table
and chair mark the carpet.  Two large windows are left open, leaving the
wispy sheer white curtains to blow gracefully in even the smallest breeze.

The Lavish Bath~
Ceramic tiles lining the floor and walls keep the room a few degrees
cooler than the rest of the house.  A sunken tub lines the eastern wall, and
it looks as though at least three people could fit in there comfortably. 
Glass counters and sink leave the room feeling larger than it actually is,
and a white toilet blends into the wall opposite the sink.  Many small white
lights sparkle above your head, acting like stars that get reflected in the
large mirror above the sink.  Lining the wall-ceiling joint are glass blocks
to let in natural light, and these stop a foot below the ceiling.  A fuzzy
dark green rug fits between the sink, toilet and tub to help keep ones feet
warm.

Large windows let in natural light which makes the dark cherry woods of
the room glow warmly.  Books fill the shelves and over flow onto the
delicately upholstered couches.  Brightly coloured Tiffany lights adorn the
small tables scattered about the room, illuminating rolled scrolls beneath
them.  A large fireplace is built of flagstone and almost fills the west
wall.  On the mantle are candles and vases full of flowers in bloom. 
Centred above it is a large picture of cliffs with a bonsai tree as the main
focus along with herons.  A glass door with white sheer curtains barely
hiding the amazing view outside is to the north.

Three small tables are scattered about the room.  Beneath each brightly

The wonderful smell of plants and flowers and fresh air invades your
nose.  The sound of trickling water rises from below, as looking down you
can see the pond amidst branches of trees.  Looking above the trees you can
see majestic mountains rising in the distance.  The purplish hue of these
mountains makes the green of the trees more intense.  Bamboo wind chimes
sound softly in the background from where they hang on the corner of the
roof.

with the Divine Crescent. The gurgle of flowing water can be barely made
out over the din of this busy section of town. To the south, the street
can be seen passing closer to the water near a pier.

You are on the brick covered roadway known as Adventurer's Way which is 
correctly named as such due to the large number of famous adventurers who 
claim it for their residences.  To the north is an elaborate mansion adorned 
with finely manicured hedges and other trappings of wealth.  Its simple yet 
amazingly beautiful design is made much more so by the fact that it well 
framed by majestic snow capped peaks far to the north.  Adventurer's way 
runs to both the east and west from this point while a large set of double 
doors leads into the mansion to the north.  A sign hangs over the door that 
leads southward, proclaiming the shop as {cGreck's Armoury{x.

before a large almost fortress-like building.  It looks quite formidable and 
well defended in its design, as if it could withstand a large assault.  To 
the north, you see majestic mountains rising above the horizon.  A discreet 
door leads southward, above which a sign hangs, reading: {cTrade Your Blade{x.

Donation Room~
This large warehouse styled building was erected in ancient times to assist
the heroes of the land. Made with exquisite materials and fashioned by
the finest craftsman, this structure was built to last an eternity. Its
smooth onyx walls glimmer with a high sheen, obviously due to years of
excellent upkeep and polishing. The perfectly tiled floors have been
etched with the names of all the heroes who have died defending the realms.
On the far side of the building you notice several tiles yet to be etched.
Perhaps someday your name too will be etched upon the face of a tile,
forever honouring your deeds. An archway exits the building to the south.

This primitive establishment has taken the precaution of bolting down all
of the furnishings.  Old tables and broken chairs are sprawled about.  Few
pictures line the walls.  The bar is grubby and unkempt.  Rotting food and
broken glass lie underneath your feet.  There is no sign of a broom, rag or
mop.  Heading east would place you into a dark passage, while a rickety
staircase leads up.
