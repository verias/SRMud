warriors.  Silent totally obedient and always on patrol.  They seem to be
lasting much longer now before the problems start and they can always be
taken down below.  On that subject we are still seeking the escaped creature
and im sure it wont be much longer before we have him.  All hail Lemrox

seen.  There are white stone pillars either side of the door, and a small
porch.  The house looks like it has two floors, the windows are leaded and
the top parts made of stained glass.  Set above the door is a crest of arms
with the name Lemrox under it.

but you can not shake the feeling that something is not quite right.

The Soul Syphon~
You are standing in a large underground cavern.  The walls and floor of
the cavern look like they have been cut out of the white rock.  In front of
you is a large metal container.  Inside that is the twitching remains of
something, possibly an elf, but now the skin is deeply wrinkled, the eyes
are dead and it looks more like a skeleton with a thin layer of skin.  Every
so often you hear a hum and you can see energy crackle up from the person
and up through pipes above the tube and into large crystals above.  All the
pipes and crystals are joined together.  The cavern continues to the north
and east and there is a passageway to the south.
