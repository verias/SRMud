Lord Godiva~
Lord Godiva is here counting the gold that he has squeezed from the townspeople.

Lord Godiva is a greedy man.  He became mayor of the fair town of Treble

little more than refuse to pay the ridiculous taxes that he has assessed on
them.  He is a hard, cruel man with one soft spot.  He truly loves his Lady
Godiva and would do ALMOST anything for her.

Balrak master~
Balrak~
The grand master of the Order of the Finch barely notices your presence.
~
It wasn't through great deeds that Balrak became grand master here.  He
was the bastard son of a powerful bard in the guild.  When the previous
master died in a duel with Norland there were no others willing to take his
place.  Balrak's father manipulated the rest of the council into naming
Balrak, thinking that he would be easily controlled.  His father paid a high
price for that mistake.

Finch.  He's still pretty bitter about it.  After his death, many of his
bard's and apprentices defected to the other orders.  Norland drove out the
rest of the Order of the Chickadee with his relentless haunting of the
tower.  His was the oldest and most respected of the four Bard's towers
until the jealousy of the other masters forced a duel.

willowy dryad~
a willowy dryad~
This willowy dryad is various shades of brown and green.
~
Eyes the same shade of green as newly unfurled leaves peer out from a deeply 
tanned face.  Her hair is a darker brown yet and grows in tangles that look 
very much like the roots of a thriving tree.  When her hair is taken into 
consideration, as well as her bark brown lips, a trace of yellow-green 
becomes apparent as an undertone in her skin.

nymph apprentice bard female~
a nymph apprentice~
This female bard must be a nymph, judging by the green tint to her skin.
~
A slight green tint is evident upon the short woman's skin, marking at
least some nymph blood.  Her figure is comely possessing a narrow waist,
wider hips and a chest which could be tactfully described as ample.  A
smattering of freckles dot her face and she possesses vivid blue eyes that
are almost startling with their intensity.  Her hair has been gathered up
into a pair of pigtails which give a girlish air to her otherwise mature
form.

a Treble guard~
This dryan serves as a guardian of Treble.
~
This dryan's brown hair is braided thickly, making his hair look much
like the roots of a tree.  His skin is a deep tan that is darker than his
hair, shining healthily.  His eyes are the green of newly unfurled leaves
and scans the surroundings constantly for any sign of trouble, or the lady
Godiva.

Treble~
You stand in the entranceway of a rather large town.  Much activity is
going on all around you.  Bards in brightly colored silks wander, singing
their tales to any who will listen.  Each tries to sing a little louder than
his fellows.  The cacophony is not unpleasant.  Ladies and gentlemen in fine
clothing hardly notice the singers as they go about their business.  Peasant
children run circles around them as they wander through town.

In the Fair City of Treble~
The town is not made up of streets as one would expect.  It is really
one big clearing with buildings randomly arranged throughout.  The only
order here is in the four corners of the clearing.  Impressive towers stand
at the corners just inside the forest line.  The town square is full of
people of all economic classes.  Peasant children respectfully stay out of
the way of the more well-born.  People here are generally cheerful and there
is music coming from every direction.

You are standing in what is perhaps the most splendid garden that you

blossoms.  A stream meanders from pond to pond.  The tinkle of the stream is
very relaxing.  The path through the garden appears to be made of crushed
opals.  Marble statues of exotic beauties line the path.  Whoever owns this

You stand in the middle of a large square lined on each side with
baskets, carts, and stands of all shapes and sizes.  The little shops are
filled with goods sold to the demanding public.  To the west, you can see
the entrance to the Baron of Bard Towers' mansion.  The mansion itself is
set back somewhat from the town itself and borders upon the Godiva gardens. 
Large iron gates have been magically warded to keep all undesirables away
from the mansion proper.  
Attached to the front of the gates is a recall glyph with the word "bard"
inscribed upon it.

Near the market~
You are in the crowded town of Treble.  To the west of you is a busy
market place.  You hear the sounds associated with that market place,
vendors trying to attract the attention of buyers and a customer complaining
about the quality of his purchase.  To the east of you is the punishment
square.  A few poor souls are locked in stocks.  An occasional groan comes
from that direction.  Additionally, there is a large number of bards here,
all practicing their craft.  They wander by in blue, red or yellow silks.

In the town of Treble~
The town of Treble is buzzing with activity.  Bards and minstrels keep
the inhabitants and visitors entertained.  To the west is a public
punishment area.  Several citizens are locked in stocks, providing
entertainment for cruel passers-by.  To the north of the stocks you can see
a gallows.  One poor soul has been left hanging there, his neck obviously
broken.

Punishment Square~
This is where those requiring punishment somewhat less than hanging are
put on public display.  Several sets of stocks are here, a few of which are
occupied.  The children of the town can often be found here throwing rotten
vegetables at those misfortunate enough to be locked here.  Bards
occasionally wander by, looking for more material for their tales.

Gallows~
This is where the townsfolk gather to watch one of their favorite
spectacles.  None would admit to enjoying the suffering of others but the
square is always full on hanging day.  A wooden platform stands near the
edge of the forest.  It has a trap-door underneath a crossbeam.  On the
crossbeam hangs a long rope at the end of which is a corpse.  His head hangs
at an odd angle.

Tower of the Nightingale~
You have entered the foyer or the huge stone tower at the north-east
corner of Treble.  The first thing that you notice are the many bards and
bard apprentices sitting on large pillows.  This is where the bards of the
Order of the Nightingale come to learn their craft.  The tower is very large
at it's base.  There are many services available here.  In fact, most
apprentice bards never leave the tower, once they enter for their training,
until they graduate to the rank of bard.

out in that you are the only one not dressed in bright red silks.  The walls

of the Nightingale.  In the corner here, a small tailor's stand has been set

There is much activity here.  Bard apprentices are practicing their
craft, hoping to someday achieve the rank of bard.  Groups of apprentices
gather around instructors eager to learn.  Amazingly, the sounds of the
flutes, mandolins and pochettes does not create a hideous cacophony.  It is
as if the walls of the tower absorb them so as to allow for so many sounds
in one place.

This chamber looks startlingly like a forest glade, made more so as the 
occasional brick of the tower is just about visible through the profusion of 
plants that flourish in this area.  Roses intermix with ivy to clamber up 
the walls and over the ceiling, sometimes hanging down like pennants.  All 
the while, grass grows over the soil covered floor, where four large pots 
have been placed amongst the blades, two to either side of the exits in the

seems to have strangely flourished within the confines of this tower.  The
gnarled and convoluted branches of the tree reach from the ceiling and down
towards the floor around the circumference of room, bearing plump fruits. 
Archways lead off to the north and west while a set of stone stairs with ivy
vines growing up its flank lead upward.  A few green pillows have been
scattered about this chamber's floor.

On the Stone Stairs~
Ivy has been skillfully trained to grow up a set of stones stairs here
that seems to lead down to a large tree on the floor below.  The hallway as
been decorated with living rose bushes, each placed in a pot that bears a
likeness of a chickadee.  These blooms send forth their delicate aroma to
the corridor as well as pleasant splashes of color to contrast with the
green of the ivy leaves and the grey of the rock work.

On The Stone Stairs~
A spiraling staircase leads up from this ivy and rose bedecked corridor,
its treads fashioned from a grey stone which can be seen to compose most of
this building.  Windows set into the wall reveal the true natural beauty of
the surrounding area: ancient forests that must have stood for more than one
age.  To the south, the passageway continues on, looking much like it does
here while the roof above seems to be fashioned from aged wood.

Dark stained wood forms the floor of this corridor that connects a pair
of spiraling stone staircases.  The stairs closest to this location lead
downwards into another hallway that looks to be decorated with ivy vines and
rose bushes while to the west this passage leads away.  Carvings depicting a
small bird, most likely a chickadee by the looks of it, to decorate the
walls along side artfully trained hanging plants that dangle in bronze
baskets.

Grey stone stairs spiral up here, reaching to a higher level of this

bird carvings upon its stone walls can be seen.  The floor way both here and
to the eastern direction is fashioned from stained timber that looks
hardened with age.  The fragrant aroma from the hanging baskets drifts to
one's nose, seemingly calculated to be pleasing to one's senses without
being obtrusive.

The Second Floor of the Tower~
Dark stained hard wood which bears a fresh layer of polish forms the
floor and roof of this corridor that ends to the west in a set of grey stone
stairs that spiral downwards and in a large chamber to the east.  Wooden
tubs have been placed at regular intervals along this hallway, each
containing a small flowering shrub that sends forth its delicate perfume to
intermix with the next, producing a pleasing fusion of scents overall.

The Second Floor of the Tower~
This chamber seems to take up most of this level of the tower.  Windows
in the eastern and northern wall permit a view of Treble and the surrounding
countryside.  A small podium that bears a painted image of a chickadee
stands towards the southern side of the room, close to an archway that is
placed there and another archway can be seen leading to a corridor through
the western wall.  Around the edge of this chamber are benches the backs of
which are fashioned into planters that bears a profusion of flowers. 
Hanging from the roof and walls of this area are baskets of molded bronze
which hold even more plants.

Before The Room Of The Grand Master~
Three archways lead from this chamber, which has been arranged for somber
study of the musical arts it would seem.  The northwards exit leads to a
more spacious room that has been filled with benches and flowers.  The
eastwards arch leads towards what appears to be a private chamber that
strangely lacks a door.  To the west, a heavy looking door bearing three
noticeable things: an image of a chickadee, a sign and, lastly, a very
strong looking bolt on this side.  One of the desks seems much older than
the others that have been placed in a commanding position close to the
window in the southern wall.

This desk is one of the few furnishings that have survived the demise of

explaining that work on the other rooms could not be completed and that two
of the workmen who where meant to be in those chambers have been found dead
at the foot of the tower, the hair on their heads bleached white by some
unknown cause.

Chamber Of The Grand Master~
This used to be the study of the grand master of the Order of the
Chickadee.  A tattered sofa covered in torn purple silk was the centerpiece
of the room.  Near the south wall a set of wooden stairs leads up further
into the tower.  A pile of ashes sits near the sofa.  It looks like someone
has attempted to clear this room of the debris, though it is clear the work
was interrupted judging by the state it is still in.

The Grand Master's Chamber~
This room has been shredded and ruined though it is still apparent that
once it must have been beautifully furnished.  A high backed chair of cherry
wood, upholstered in purple, sits facing the door close to a window that
gives an encompassing view of the forests around Treble.  A purple carpet
used to adorn the floor now it remains as a tattered ghost of its former
self.  An arched doorway stands to the west, the wood showing marks of some
conflict upon it and a spiraling staircase leads downwards.

Grand Master's Sleeping Chamber~
This must have been someone's sleeping chamber, once.  A simple bed is at
the center of the room, blood soaked from a very long time ago--perhaps it
was the occupant's death bed.  Nearby there is a broken wooden table and a
wardrobe that has fallen on its side at the other end of the bed.  A chain
attaches to the trap door that is high above.  A glance eastward shows what
appears to have been a sitting room of sorts, though it is in tatters now. 
An unnatural chill seems to fill the room, which does not seem to be a
product of the shattered window that overlooks the forests to the west.

On A Wooden Ladder~
An old ladder leads up from what looks to be a bedroom below to a
trapdoor set into the roof above, some of the rungs on the ladder have been
broken, though whether or not it was intentional is a mystery.  The grey
stone of the walls seems to possess a coldness one would not expect as they
seem to be attempting to leech all warmth from this area. A faint melody
echoes through the air, the tune a lament, the likes of which hasn't been
heard in years.

You are at the top of one of the four bard towers of Treble.  There are
windows on all sides of you.  To the north and east you can look out over
the busy town below you.  To the west and south you see the tranquil forest
that surrounds the town.  In the center of the room is a huge tarnished
birdcage which holds the carcasses of many small birds.  The door to the
cage is closed and a bolt holds it shut.

You find yourself inside a large beaten cage.  It was once very grand
with delicate gold work decorating the top and around the base.  The ground
is littered with the carcasses of nearly a hundred small birds.  Bird feces
is piled thickly on the ground too.  A tray hangs about waist-high and it is
empty.  It appears that the poor inhabitants of this cage starved to death.

You are beneath an ivy-choked arbor that leads from the overgrown gardens
to the north to the dilapidated house to the south.  The arbor was once a
source of pride for the Cromwell family who owns this garden and house but
years of neglect have surrendered it to the ever-voracious ivy.  To the
south is a small wooden door which barely hangs from it's iron hinges.

Sitting Room~
This was once the sitting room where generations of Cromwells gathered to
share each other's company.  It was a happy place until the evil Lord Godiva
forced the family into near poverty with his outrageous taxes.  There is
only one piece of furniture left here, a small wooden bench which doubles as
a chest.  It is dull from going years without polishing.  The hearth at the
south end of the room stands empty.  The rest of the rooms furnishings have

This was the maid's quarters when the Cromwell family was one of the more
well-to-do families in the town of Treble.  Now, the widow Cromwell stays in
this room with her young son.  It is easier to heat this small room then it
would be to heat the larger ones in the house.  The furnishings are sparse. 
Two thin mattresses lie on the floor covered with moth-eaten quilts.  The
hearth has a small fire in it giving the room a bit of cheer.

The Mistress's Chamber~
Uncountable plants decorate this chamber though none of the types seem
recognizable, including roses that slowly fluctuate in color before your
eyes, daisies of unparalleled sizes and other oddities.  It is almost as if
some kind of magic has been employed or is still being employed.  Electric
blue ivy covers the walls in most places though one point seems strangely
void of plant life.  A large bed of moss sits in the centre of the chamber,
easily big enough for several people to lay upon, other than that the only
furniture seems to be a small wooden chest which is placed at the foot of
the bed.

void strangely wall~
As you look at this part of the wall the hairs on the back of your neck
rise then your mind suddenly seems to be gazing down at this chamber but
everything is different: 

It looks like this abandoned room has been converted into a shrine to the
God Eris.  The conversion looks to have been fairly recent.  Most of the
room is bare.  There are simply a few benches to sit on arranged in a
roughly circular fashion.  The walls are covered in graffiti, from simple
daubings such as "Order sucks!"  To complex theological arguments as to why
intelligent beings should lead their own lives.  While there is nothing
particularly holy about the place, there is a definite sense of presence and
power here.  You know from common knowledge that the best place to contact a
God is at their sacred places through prayer.  This would seem to be one of
those sacred places.  

Then your consciousness returns to the present, you are in a chamber filled
with strange plants and a moss bed.  The uneasiness that looking at the wall
instilled in you remains briefly then fades.

utensils for it carefully arranged around it.  A small spiral stair case
leads upwards from this room.

pillows have been piled high near the head board and the mattress looks soft
and inviting.  A chest, iron bound stands at the foot of the bed for the
owner of this home to place there belongings before resting here.  Upon the
walls pictures and lyrics from popular songs of bards towers are set within
frames, most likely gifts from the people of bards to the guardian.  A
spiral stair case leads down from here.
