massive tail that it is able to whip around with lightening speed.

attempting to brush with a piece of shaped bone.  It is only when she
notices you and moves that her fish-like tail becomes apparent, marking her
as one of the sirens known as a mermaid.

wool but its about the size of a adult cave bear.  Great curved horns loop

This must be a blood mist so named due to its habit of draining the life
blood from the living.  The slight pinkish color is due to blood remaining
in its cloud like body.  A thin web like structure seems to be all that
makes up the monster.  Around this web an ever present fog helps to conceal
it.

law1~
That no vampire may ever destroy another vampire, except the clan Master,
who has the power of life and death over all of his flock.  And it is
further his obligation to lead the old ones and the mad ones into the fire
when they can no longer serve as they should.  It is his obligation to
destroy all vampires who are not properly made.  It is his obligation to
destroy all those who are so badly wounded that they cannot survive on their
own.  And it is his obligation finally to seek the destruction of all
outcasts and all those who have broken these laws.  
~
E
law2~
Only clan Masters may embrace others, who have been selected from
council.  Should someone else embrace another without permission, both
parties will be punished severely and painfully.  That the Dark Gifts must
never be given to the crippled, the maimed, or to children, or to those who
cannot, even with the Dark Powers survive on their own.  Be it further
understood that all mortals who would receive the Dark Gifts should be
beautiful in person so that the insult to the Gods might be greater when the
trick is done.  
~
E
law3~
All hunters of our race are to hunted down and taught lessons of respect
until they either learn, or die, by any means necessary.  
~
E
law4~
Respect and loyalty within the family is the highest importance.  Respect
of those outside the family is important too.  Without them, there would be
no food.  Treat others with the respect you would show your own family at
all times.  
~
E
law5~
That no vampire shall ever reveal his true nature to a mortal and let the
mortal live.  No vampire must ever reveal the history of the vampires to a
mortal and let the mortal live.  No vampire must commit to writing the
history of the vampires or any true knowledge of vampires lest such a
history be found by mortals and believed.  And never must any vampire reveal
to mortals the location of his or any other vampire's lair.

Under the Sea~
It is difficult to tell how deep one is in this watery bed, but it can't
be too deep as the light from the surface world penetrates this far.  It
becomes less and less useful the deeper one tries to scan, but it still
illuminates peaceful groups of fish that swim about in tight groups, their
scales shining with bright colors.  Dark shadows wiggle through the water
below, seeming to be much larger than the gayly colored fish that swim here.

The water teases the plant growth here, causing pockets of air to rise
toward the surface, where light filters through.  The illumination is too
poor to penetrate much deeper toward the floor, but it serves to show the
bright fish that swim in teams in their search of food.  Every now and then,
a larger fish rises from the depths to snack upon the tropical animals that
are near you.

The surface of the sea can be detected directly above, shimmering
slightly when it is illuminated with natural light.  Far below, the water
becomes darker and less definition of shapes can be made out, but the sea
floor is not apparent just yet.  As for here, there are schools of gayly
colored fish swimming about, trying to avoid you as you displace the salt
water in their path.

Algae and free drifting kelp float through the water here, looking very

fails to define the contents of the water below, making the swimming shapes
in that depth look like little more than wiggling masses of darkness.

A few strands of seaweed climbs toward the light from the depths below,
the bed of kelp tickling any skin that comes in contact with.  The currents
that run through the grass of the sea make them move like hair when it is
submerged in water.  The light from above is not enough to make the
algae-filled depths of the ocean clear, but one can see the dark shapes of
other creatures swimming further below.

Bubbles of air come from the depths of the ocean below, following a
stirring of something large.  Schools of fish with bright red, yellow, and
white markings swim at speed through the water here, their slim finned
bodies wiggling with an otherworldly grace.  Algae and brine shrimp float
through on the flowing salt water.  The surface to the ocean seems to be
just above, as some dappled light filters from above.

The water shimmers above and partially lights this area, allowing one a
plain view of hordes of tetra fish swimming in schools.  If you watch these
strange clear-bodied fish longer, a larger silvery fish comes along and
scoops up a handful of the unsuspecting animals and then swims away.  Algae
floats by on the currents that flow through here, bringing a blast of warm
water as it travels along.  Further below, one can barely make out the large
shapes of other creatures moving along.

A short burst of movement disrupts the kelp and fish swimming below you,
sending the living creatures scattering rather abruptly.  It is too dark to
see clearly what caused this fright, however, as the light from the surface
above is too weak to penetrate the algae-laden waters.  The fish soon return
to their normal paths and swim in schools back and forth as they search out
their sustenance.

The buoyant waters of the sea provide a steady resistance to all your
efforts of swimming, the moving water playing with your clothes and hair
alike, moving them as if under a lover's caress.  The water is warm here but
gets colder the deeper one swims, and seems to lose definition in the
depths, as well; the light of the surface world doesn't penetrate very far
into the stygian fluid.

Creatures stir in the depths, hidden both in the relative darkness and

bodies in vibrant yellow, red, and snowy white.  Algae mixed with shrimp
floats by on the currents, littering your submerged body with deposits of
their particles.

The Serpent's Head~
Encased in the frigid waters of the seas inner bowels, you find yourself
staring into the hollow eye-sockets of a immense sea serpent.  Thankfully it
is only the skeletal remains of this once fearsome being.  Its gaping,
toothy maw invites you to travel down its former gullet into the musky cave
where the rest of its corpse rests, surrounded by water and stone.

they span far above your reach and a strange circle of green glowing light.

Almost running into the solid stone that blocks your path, you have
finally reached the end of the cave here in what once must have been the sea
serpents tail.  Small bones about the size of your arm litter the sediment
rich floor, inviting your tread upon their sharp edges.  Little can be told
of what this cave once held before this monster came to dwell and die within
it, as the stone walls of this cave are quite unremarkable if smooth, due to
the constant chill current.

A country road~
This is the fertile plateau of the twin rivers of TrystenVeldt.
The road has a well travelled feel about it.  Dust and stones
line the roadsides, and occasional potholes make walking slightly more
difficult.  Snow capped mountains loom in the distant north, and curling
smoke can be seen from rooftops to the south.  To the east, there is a
dwindling forest.  Fallow land spreads westward, and a broad tributary can
be seen flowing down from the northern peaks.  The road continues to meander
to the north and south.

The road travels north and south, through smoothly rolling foothills. 
The farmlands to the west appear to be less than prosperous.  Rocky
outcroppings stand out starkly along the hillsides, while here and there,
sheep attempt to graze upon the sparse grass growing amidst the rocks.  In
the distance, to the east and west, you can make out the silver threads of
two rivers.

Along the River's Edge~
The shoreline of the lazy Cameria river is difficult to distinguish.  The
water depth gradually lessens until the terrain can be best described as a
sloppy wet bog.  Gigantic skunk cabbage with thick green leaves the size of
capes grow in the wetness.  To the west, the Cameria dumps it's silty water
into the deep blue ocean.

Prairie grass has begun to fill in the ruts of this wide road.  To the
north and south waist-high grass ripples in the wind over the rolling hills.
To the west the remains of the road wander over a gentle hill which stands a
bit higher than the rest.  On the horizon to the north-east is what appears
to be a smallish town nestled up next to a thick forest.

The surrounding garden is of miniature proportions yet pleasant
appearance.  Precisely four rows of what seems to be carrots dominate the
very center of it, while the sides suggest a few large bushes of diminutive
flowers, tinged a pale yellow.  A natural lawn of thorny bushes walls the
garden all around, at the southwestern corner of which a pair of thick
wooden logs rest, undoubtedly serving as seats.  Strangely, a great number
of footprints are apparent on the soft soil, much resembling footprints of
wolves or similiar animals.

the stone cliff face.  Whoever, or whatever, did that must be powerful
indeed.  Perhaps, it is wise for only those who are sufficiently experienced
adventurers to disturb what lays in wait at the top of the cliff.  Below,
the West Discordia rushes to the sea to the south.  From this vantage point
you can see the City of Discordia and a few ships in its harbors.

At the Top of the Cliff~
A lush, green field is abruptly met by the great stone cliff.  One false
step here could lead to a long fall into the rushing waters of the West
Discordia river.  If one were to survive the fall they would be swept to sea
where all kinds of sea life is eager for a tasty meal.  To the north the
fields continue until they are choked off by a thick forest in the far
distance.

On the River Near the Docks~
The wide Western Discordia river flows gently to the south past the town
of Discordia.  Boats of all sizes navigate the waterway.  Many are tied up
to the docks, unloading and loading merchandise.  The water is clear and
cold, a suggestion that its source is snow runoff.  Directly to the east is
a short pier which sits several feet above the water level.  Seagulls sit on
the railing, supervising all river activity.  An old wooden ladder leads up
to the pier.

West Discordia River~
The river here moves slowly and deliberately southward past the town of
Discordia, which sits on a high bank to the east.  Looking in that
direction, you can see many buildings.  A large domed structure is visible
past the docks.  To the south, the river continues its march to the sea.

North of the Fork~
The river is wide and slow here.  Navigation is easy and a few ships are
anchored near the edges waiting their turns at the docks to the north.  The
river seethes to the west into a dark swampy area.  To the north, on a
grass-covered hill sits a great stone building with a dome-shaped roof. 
River otters play near the shores, swimming on their backs.  Fish hang from
their paws.

Where East meets West~
The two forks of the river slam violently against each other at this spot
creating the Great Discordia.  The swifter Eastern Discordia river plows
fiercely into the wider, slower moving Western Discordia river.  Huge
whirlpools are formed here making navigation by boat very treacherous. 
Debris from more than one boat wreck lines the shores on either side.  To
the north is a grass covered bluff, on top of which the Temple of Discordia
rises.  The wide Great Discordia cuts through the landscape to the south.

In front of the castle~
You stand atop a high bluff, overlooking the the city of Discordia, which
is a sprawling town.  Beyond the city, the Neru sea can be seen.  The view
from here is magnificent.  A lush, green field stretches to the north and
east.  To west and continuing north, a gaping canyon cuts through the land. 
The West Discordia river winds its way through it.  Sitting majestically
near the edge of the bluff is a gleaming white castle.  It appears to be the
abode of something very powerful.  Perhaps it is wise to stay away and not
disturb the inhabitants.

Eastern Discordia River Near the Temple~
Eastern Discordia River roars violently from the north where it crosses
under a large stone bridge.  To the south it meets the slightly more serene
Western Discordia River to form the Great Discordia River.  High on the
western river bank is a large stone temple with a great dome.  A beautiful
garden surrounds the temple.  The wind carries flower petals to the river
where they are crushed in the raging waters.

The East Discordia river churns over rapids here.  Large rocks sit
dangerously just under the water, waiting to bash the poor fool who falls
in.  Navigation by boat is tricky here.  Overhead, a large stone bridge
spans the river.  To the north, the river rushes swiftly past high,
grass-covered banks.  On the western bank a lively town sits.  Far to the
north, a spectacular mountain range cuts across the sky.  A path leads up a
steep bank to the bridge above.

Mouth of the Cameria~
The lazy Cameria pours its silty cargo into the vast blue ocean waters at
this point.  The mouth is wide and is so slow moving as to appear almost
lake-like.  Were it not for the wave action of the sea, it would be nearly
completely still.  The river banks are wet peat bogs with thin reeds and
skunk-cabbage plants of impressive proportions.  Sand bars and silt from the
river combine directly to the south, their sodden mess preventing travel to
the ocean beyond.

The sea seems to boil even as the sky does the same, waves rise higher

heavenwards, its salty tang speaking of the deeps that is has risen from.  A
shiver runs along your spine, almost as if you can sense rather than see
some form of magic at work behind this mighty storm, though no true source
can as yet be determined.  The traitorous sea seems to stretch out in all
directions even if the truth of this matter can no be determined due to the
tempest.

in the distance you can see a great domed building.  Further yet, a set of

out of the water, which swirls around it.  Water birds rest atop the
boulders, seeming amused at the effort expended by the sailors of the ships
trying to navigate these waters.

Discordia River~
Looming rock and red clay bluffs rise dramatically from both sides of the
river.  They are so high that you can't see what lies beyond their edge. 
The water moves swiftly through Discordia Canyon, carved out over
millenniums by the rushing waters.  High on the eastern cliff face is what
appears to be a small, dark opening.  The river carries all traffic
purposefully south here.  To the south the canyon opens into a vast sea. 
There's a small outcropping of rocks to the west which are low enough that a
person could dock there.

The water here carries you past Dockside West, giving you a good view of the 
various goings-on there.  Choppy water beats against the wood of the docks 
to the east and provides a percussive counterpoint to the whistling wind.  
The Western Discordia River accomodates several boats here, many laden with 
goods and a few heading out for more.  Seagulls dart about, diving at you 
occassionally in search of the food they KNOW you carry.  A river otter 
peeks out from the choppy water, a fish in her jaws, and lies back to enjoy 
her prize.  The western shore is lined with thick forest, and the faint 
sounds of various birds fill the air.

the base of an imposing mountain range which runs north south at this
point.  To the north, the range curves to run east-west.  Looking up, it
appears that ascending it would be very perilous.  On the south side of the
road is the beginning of a deep dark forest.  The smell of pine drifts from
that direction.  North, you can see the gates of some type of settlement.

Everything is damp and chilly.  Above, you can hear what appear to be birds
clicking in the trees.  Branches swish against each other, presumably when
the animals above hop from one to another.  Occasionally, water falls in
large droplets from the branches above.  A tall neat house with a plain
wooden door sits tucked amongst trees to the west here.

mountain range creates a majestic skyline.  The fertile twin river valley
lies to the northeast.

West Discordia Road~
The road wanders through some fairly steep foothills here and begins to
cut through the outer edge of the forest.  To the north you can still see
through the trees to the majestic mountains but to the south the forest is
so thick you can see only a few wagon lengths through the tree.  The road is
wide and well travelled here.  It continues east towards Discordia and turns
a bit to the north.

On the River~
The water here carries you past Dockside West, giving you a good view of the 
various goings-on there.  Choppy water beats against the wood of the docks 
to the east and provides a percussive counterpoint to the whistling wind.  A 
handful of boats float about, some with a load of goods heading into or out 
of the city.  A fisherman is anchored in the middle of the river, trying his 
luck.  The western shore is covered in forest, and you hear the cry of 
seagulls to the south.

This is a thick trail which travels roughly north-south through some
foothills.  The hills themselves are rocky slopes.  Tufts of grass and small
shrubs grow randomly over the faces of the hills.  From the top of the hill
a walled-off residence can be seen in a valley to the north.  Just past the
residence a mountain rises swiftly skyward.  To the east a wide river flows
down from the mountain range.

West Discordia Road~
The road is wide and smooth here.  It wanders through the northern edge
of a forest at the base of a mountain range.  A thin trail leads off to the
north and disappears over the top of one of the many foothills in this area.
To the south the road cuts through a thickening forest.  To the west the
forest is light and the base of the trees is padded with thick green moss. 
Perfect for a nap.

Although the road is wide and maintained it has a cramped feeling.  It
traverses a deep thick forest.  The air is damp and smells of decaying wood
and moss.  Light filters only weakly through the trees giving this part of
the road an eerie quality.  Far to the south the forest appears to open up
some.  To the north it disappears over some steep foothills.

toward the forest to the west.  You can see some of the darker alleys to the

doorway.  The broken windows of the buildings seem to follow you like eyes.  
The sounds of gulls echo from the south, and the water laps against the wood 
of the docks.

A narrow trail winds its erratic course through the trees here, working from 
a cobbled road that is just visible to the north towards more dense woodland 
to the east.  The grass here has been worn somewhat short, most likely due 
to the activities of children from the northwards city.  Over the tops of 
the trees to the northwest a massive structure is visible, being formed from 
gold by the looks of it and temple-like in appearance.

A Track Into The Forest~
This road leads into a thick, cool forest.  Tall trees, covered with lichen 
loom above you.  The air smells of pine, cedar and mold.  Huge mushrooms, 
big enough for several meals, cling to the trunks of the trees.  The sound 
of rushing water comes from the east.  A steady clicking noise fills the 
air, the monotony of it driving home quickly with each tap, as if some 
unseen creature was counting out each second, or perhaps your every breath.  
An almost undetectable moaning sound accompanies the click, click, click, 
neither of the sounds seem to echo but are ever present and eerie.

visible, judging by its size it must be an ocean.

The following hut offers a true picture of poverty, with its bare wooden
walls and strikingly scarce furnishing.  A pair of uninviting bed line the
eastern wall, sticking into the small room, while a pathetic looking kitchen
occupies the western wall.  A miniature fireplace serves both as a stove and
as a heating device, situated at the western wall as well.  Otherwise, the
room itself is kept clean and tidy, what must be an easy job - there are too
few objects to form a real mess.  A small wooden door leads outside to a
small garden down south.

The river flows to the border of Discordia City, which rises to the south in 
stark contrast to the surrounding terrain.  Forest on either side lends a 
peaceful atmosphere, and various birds call out to whomever will listen.  A 
deer ambles out of the thick brush and stops to look at you, then lowers her 
head to take a drink.  The snow-capped mountains are plainly visible to the 
north.  A bridge stretches over the river high above and tree roots that 
look very much like steps scale the bankside to allow the adventurous to 
climb up to the town above.  At a distance over head a wooden bridge spans 
the river, the aged planks of which are held in place by thick logs.

Crystal clear mountain water flows beneath the narrow wooden bridge.  The
river, which is little more than a stream here, gathers together various
creeks and streamlets along its path to become the West Discordia River to
the south.  Strong old growth logs hold the wooden bridge firmly in place
above the rushing water.  The bridge leads east towards the outskirts of the
town of Discordia and west towards a forested area.

over your head.  Huge boulders have fallen from the cliff-face, dislodged by
the pounding water, and now form walls of rock around the water.  If you

breeze.  A large rock can be seen to the east.

Water slides down a steep embankment that blocks any further view to the

hillside, though an occassional sapling struggles for life on the slope.  
Several types of {mf{rl{co{xw{ye{mr{x peek out of the mist beside the water, mingling with 
multi-hued {gmoss{x and lending a sweet overtone to the damp air.  The river 
continues on its way south.

In the Lee of a Cliff~
The blue waters of the ocean stretch away to the south, the waves of
which collide with the cliff that forms a barrier to both the north and
west.  The steady lapping at the rock is a testament of the attempt of the
water to claim the land, and its effects are starting to become apparent
with the shelf that is now carved into the rock face.  Several boats, of
merchant and naval nature both, can be seen travelling over the steady
waves.

Near the Coastline~
The repeated booming sound caused as waves slap against the unyielding
stone of the northwestern cliffs brings forth a siphon of noise which all
but drowns out the songs of the sea birds calling to each other.  To the
south and east the sea seems considerably safer, the waters softly lapping
upon each other without a hint of the deadly rocks that line the base of
these cliffs.  Upon the zenith of the cliffs a green smudge can be seen,
which one would guess are either trees or grass though at this distance it
is impossible to tell.

The Docks of Tortuguero~
A thick jungle hides away a small town to the north from behind an
expanse of golden sand.  Far to the north, above the dense growth, a
mountain with ribbons of black smoke rising from it can be seen clearly.  A
wooden structure connects the water and the land, serving as the port of
Tortuguero.  Birds circle overhead, reading to snag a fish from the sea or
steal some food from the sailors that come and go.  A small road leads from
this jetty to the west, providing an entrance to Tortuguero. The blue water
that comprises the temperamental ocean continues on with no sign of ending
to the east.

South of the Great Discordia~
The great ocean stretches as far to the south as you can see and appears
to fall off the end of the world.  The water is deep blue in most places. 
To the west it appears to be opaque and the color is difficult to define,
being somewhere between blue and green.  Random ships dot the waters here
and there.  Rocky cliffs define the northern edge of the sea.  The waves
slam violently into them creating spray the reaches nearly to the top. The
water hugs a cliffside to the west and seems passable.

Sea of Neru~
The gentle lapping of the waves holds a relaxing quality, lulling to
one's senses with its continuous actions and unhurried motions.  Small
shapes wheel high overhead and judging by the sounds of their faint calls,
they must be sea gulls though it is unusual for one to descend so that
anyone upon this stretch of water can truly perceive one to be certain. 
Seawater can be seen in all directions, seeming one continuous body of fluid
that is only occasionally broken by a dark shape on the horizon.

Sea of Neru~
The rolling sea stretches off in all directions, its blue-green surface
looking serene and unalterable.  The scent of the ocean continually drifts
upwards from the body of water, inescapable from this position upon it and
forcing a salty tang to fill the lungs and coat one's flesh.  Dark masses
line the horizons, whether this is an optical illusion or something is truly
present can not really be determined at this point.

In the Lee of a Cliff~
Random ships dot the seawater here and there, some of which are merchant
ships travelling between ports to trade for riches.  The great sea extends
to the west and south without an apparent end, the water holding a tinge of
blue in its briny depths.  The water is slightly muddy here from the silt of
the Great Discordia, the mineral-rich soil helping a profusion of kelp to
grow here.  Rocky cliffs define the northern edge of the ocean here, looking
quite dangerous in their own right.  On a large outcropping, a tall round
building that streams with light can be seen, to help guide the sailors to
land.

Along the Coast~
A river at the east dumps into the sea here, stirring silt into the
otherwise clear waters.  Scarlet pimpernels grow freely on the shoreline to
the north, amidst the sandy soil and driftwood.  The ocean opens up to the
west and south from here, becoming more treacherous with the ill-famed rip
tides and sea serpents that are well known to litter the great waters.  A
gentle spray is produced by the waves lapping against each other, the sound
from this almost relaxing.

Sea of Neru~
The constant slosh, slosh, slosh of the ocean here sounds almost like a
lullaby to one's ears, continuing as the waves rise and then tumble softly
back onto themselves over and over.  The water possesses a blue tint,
somewhat reminiscent of a summer's sky in color, which also adds to the
serene feel of this area.  Only the aroma of the salt water dispels any
feelings of peace, along with the occasional cry of a distant sea bird.

A Swampy Shore~
The river shore is low lying and swampy.  An odour of sulphur and rotting
detritus rises from the thick, oozing mud.  To the east, the Great Discordia
River flows southwards, and beyond, you can make out the cliffs of the
eastern shore.  To the west, Cypress trees, covered in mossy growth, rise
out of the water, casting strangely shaped silhouettes against the sky.  The
ground, which rises slightly to the south, appears to be forming a path.

breaking through the pools, are almost threatening in their formation.  The

that a small city exists on the bottom.  You catch a glimpse of a
fantastical creature that appears to be part fish and part tervadi.

wide enough for several humanoids to travel abreast, just above ground
level.  The walls of the fissure are rough and sparkle with tiny flecks of
mica.  At the fissure opening a faint trail leads through rolling foothills.
Deep inside the fissure you can hear the sounds of some sort of living
beings.

you gaze at the view of the forest below you.  A city can be seen far to the 
south, and beyond that the sea opens into the horizon.  To the north, the 
river tumbles from a greater height, and the snow-capped mountains can be 
seen above.  Pine forest lines both sides of the river, and the heady scent 
blends with the mist to create an invigorating atmosphere.  Boulders large 
and small dot the river and create a musical turbulence in the current.

The river slams into a sheer stone wall to the south, as if a large chunk of 
the mountain were sliced out by an enormous blade.  More large boulders 
stand nearby, churning the current even more.  The roar of the water is 
almost deafening, from this white-water bend and from the enormous cascade 
seen to the north.  The pine trees thin out toward the cascade, and the 
temperature is noticeably cooler here.  Snow-capped mountains loom to the 
north, silent white sentinels watching all below with an unblinking gaze.

The roar of the cascade drowns out all thought and echoes through the
thick mist lingering around the stone and trees.  The descending water
carries a chilling breeze from the heights.  A large bear stands in the
water, intently focused on snaring an elusive fish.  The slope rises high
above, the gray marred only by the occassionaly lichen, and the river
continues on its southward path.

under the flow of the downward current, and several small fish fight the
turbulence to scour the bottom of the pool for scraps of food.  The wet
slope extends above and below from here.

Above a Towering Cascade~
The cold river flows from its northern mountain source, intensified by
snowmelt from either side.  Spruce and pine trees stand watch, sheltering
small wintergreen plants in their shadows.  A raptor's call echoes around
you in contrast to the roar of the current. The river drops off of a sheer
cliff, flowing down to a ledge partially hidden by mist.  Two large rock
outcroppings interrupt the downward flow, with patches of dull green moss
growing on top of them.  Small saplings erupt from the mountainside below. 
In the distance, signs of civilization can be detected, and the river joins
with the vast expanse of sea beyond that.

three small snowmelt rivulets from the north.  The joining of waters creates
a white-water turbulence, further churned by multiple gray stones that sit
in the riverbed.  Short spruce and pine trees line the river, decorated with
tiny icicles and sprinklings of snow.  A roar can be heard to the south,
indicating a waterfall of considerable size.

flows westward from the fall, and a roar can be heard over the current from
that direction.

holes that look to be part of the rock, but are spaced to perfectly to be

Discordia river rushing past the cliff, while high above you all you can see

breaking any mirror-like effects there might have been.  In the distance to
the east and west are the banks of the river, which are gradually turning
into great rock cliffs covered in thick lush forests.  The banks look
impossible to climb at this point, and off to the north you can see a break
in the forest that looks to be an opening for the river.

large lake-section of the river and suddenly drops its load of large pebbles
here, creating shallow sand-bar effects beneath the surface here.  High
above, tall trees tower above the cliffs, almost seeming to bend over,
looming down on you.  The water to the north looks far more difficult to

in your ears as it echoes off the slick rock walls surrounding you.  You
notice a small formation of rocks along the eastern wall of the cliff that
creates a shallow pool of water where you could safely leave the water. 
Looking up from the water, you see what looks like a steep foot path that
has yet to be fully packed down by travel.

The dirt along this path is wet and slick, giving you poor footing as you
try and navigate it.  Luckily, there are many trees which offer hand holds,
and these trees roots try to create natural steps to make this journey
easier.  Looking down, you can see the raging waters where the waterfall
smashes into ground to continue its journey downstream to the south.  You
realise that there is nothing but yourself preventing you from falling into
that water to the west.  The top of the cliff is only a short climb up,
whereas down you can see a calm pool of water sheltered by algae-covered
rocks.

still pales in comparison to the Tortuguero mansion.  In this foyer, the
ceiling is high.  On one wall is a large table designed with the purpose of
dining in mind.  It is made of a blood red mahogany, and has four very
stable legs.  On the north wall lies a large ornate fireplace.  The red
stones of the fireplace are quite clean, the ashes long since swept away by
passing breezes, and you can tell that the fireplace has not been used in
quite a long time.  On the west wall lies a door which leads into the
personal chambers of the inhabitant.

A Boarded Cellar~
Wooden boards cover the walls that must be made of packed earth.  A hatch
set into the roof appears to be the only exit from this room.  Looking
around you see a fair selection of torture devices.  A large rack sits in
the center of this room, oiled and only missing a victim for it to be used
on.  Hooks and rings have been set into the rafters of what must be the room
above.  A brazier stands cold in the western corner, ready to be lit for
use.  Racking and tables set against the eastern wall hold all manner of
whips, flails, knives and pincers for the use of causing pain.

Inside a Log Cabin~
Warmed throughout by a large stone fire place set into the northern most
wall of this spacious log cabin single room seems comfortable enough.  A
large carved wooden bed stands in the south western corner, while a table
and chairs sit in the center of the room.  Dyed, woven rush rugs cover the
the polished wooden floor.  A royal seal over the mantle shows this to be a
home owned by the crown.  No windows are set into any of the walls.  Pots
and pans for cooking hang over the fire, but seem not have have been used in
some time, to say the least.  A heavy wooden door to the east seems to be
the exit.

The Waiting Room~
A large, cold, impersonal room surrounds you, designed to make you feel
small and insignificant.  The floor spreads our beneath you like a mirror of
black, reflecting the dim blue lighting that is sparsely spaced along the
walls.  The walls themselves seem to be made of perfectly smooth and
seamless metal, though not polished to a shine.  Along the northern and
southern walls are small black leather sofas and chairs, set up like a
waiting line to something you are unsure of.  Set in the eastern wall is a
shiny black door, made of something smooth, cold and heavy to the touch. 
Looking up, all you can see is blackness, and you can't tell where the
ceiling really is, or even if there is one at all.  You notice there are
absolutely no windows anywhere, or any type of decoration.

The Meeting Room~
The floor spreads out beneath you like perfectly still black water. 
Metallic walls rise from this reflective blackness making you feel like
you've just stepped into the future.  Though the room is large, and you
can't even make out a ceiling looking up into blackness, there are
absolutely no sounds, and any that you make are muted by some magical unseen
force.  The only door in this room is a large shiny black one set in the
centre of the western wall.  Set importantly in the middle room is a long
glass table surrounded by large comfortable armchairs covered with black
leather.  The walls hold only small blue lights which cast a cool dim
lighting over the room and a large scroll covered with glass set in the
centre of the eastern wall.

Underwater~
The moderately cool waters engulf you gently yet thoroughly as you dive
into the depths, introducing you into a flowing underwater realm, full of
life and blueish-greenish colours.  Aquatic flora sways and trembles
gracefully to the rushing current, covering the squishy ground nearly
completely.  The flora consists of quite a few different plants, some of
which display plain design and but a single colour, while others boast
intricate leaves and even lavish, colourful flowers.  A rather intriguing
black rock lies at the bottom of the river to the southwest, nearly
completely veiled by the greenery.

A Narrow Staircase~
The seemingly stern set of stairs rise gallantly from the rushing waters,
leading you into a thankfully dry, completely bare compartment of space. 
The stairs themselves offer a rather well kept appearance, and even the air
seems to be at movement and quite clear to breathe.  The walls are mostly
indistuinguishable, each bearing a thin line of dark red.  The red line
emerges from the waters below, stretching across the walls and vanishing
inside the leaves of a thick plant at the top of the stairs.  Indeed, a
visibly ancient, knotty ivy plant has found its way into this chamber,
falling gracefully from the ceiling all the way to the floor.

A Hidden Archive~
An ever so slight, ever so tingling mustiness encloses you upon entrance
to this rather widely extent, rectangularly designed library.  Hardly much
of a bother, the mustiness clearly tells a great amount of slowly deceasing
paper.  Indeed, as much as the darkness permits, a decent number of rows of
shelves can be seen standing imposingly throughout the length of the
chamber.  Lurking silently upon the many shelves are literally countless
tomes and books of all imaginable designs and colours.  Although this
chamber clearly speaks of old and even ancient age, the overall condition of
it seems quite well, as if regularly cared for.

Top of a Cliff Along the Cameria River~
You are surrounded by forest here, with the great Cameria River flowing
south to your west.  You can see a massive waterfall dumping the Cameria
River down a few hundred feet.  Large trees and thick foliage surround you
here, but you can see the faintest signs of a footpath leading down the
cliff face.

The thick cool forest thins here, giving way to a field to the east.  A
roaring sound can be heard faintly in the distance to the west, indicating
the position of the Cameria River to your position.  Off in the distance to
the south-east, you can see the spires of what could be a castle poking over
the long grasses in the field.  From this vantage point, you can see the
forest running parallel to the Cameria River, north and south, while
everywhere else is just long expanses of fields.

A Large Field~
Tall grasses surround you, brushing past your legs, clinging gently
before letting go to bend and sway in the gentle breeze that seems to be a
constant feature here.  Burrs and nettles grab onto your clothing, digging
in deep, to join you with your travels around the land.  All around you the
constant chirping of crickets can be heard, rising and falling in waves,
circling you.  The field continues all around you, but the grasses have been
bent apart in a form of a path to the south.  Looking south, you can see a
thinning grasses and then sand, lots of sand.

The Beginning Of A Desert~
Tough looking grass starts to give way to acrid sands to the south, while
to the north, the countryside seems more pleasant and welcoming.  Westwards,
one can see a rock face which appears to follow the desert with birds
circling high above the cliff, dancing upon the deserts thermals.  Something
about this expanse of sand seems unnatural though nothing really indicates
it as such other than possibly its location.

to an alter to the east.

A Solemn Desert~
A sea of sand stretches off to the south, unbroken and unmarred until the
horizon, where a domed structure is evident.  This building must truly be of
an impressive size to be visible, from this distance.  Heat rises from the
sun bakes sand, causing one's throat and nose to feel perpetually dry and
the only fragrance is that of the heated granules.  To the west, a low set
of cliff faces is visible looking inhospitable with their wind-worn faces. 
Sand continues to stretch away to the north and south.

Inside A Tree~
The inside of this great ancient tree has been hollowed out, though the
tree still grows strong.  All the furniture and long tables filling the room
have been carved from the tree itself as well.  A few small windows let you
see the forests surrounding this place, but little else.  You see some
stairs leading up into darkness that are more of varying-sized pieces of the
tree than real stairs.  Against the far wall a huge fireplace has been built
of large stones, partly to protect the tree, and partly for contrast in the
warm golds and browns of the room.  Everything is completely spotless. 
There is a piece of paper set neatly on the long table in front of you.  A
door is set in the tree to the east, leading back out to the swamps.

A Beaten Path~
Groves of fruit trees crowd together here, their blossoms a colorful and
fragrant bouquet among the mingling leaves.  A few of the recognizable trees
are those bearing apples, pears, plums and cherries, fruits from their past
ripenings still rotting amongst the fallen logs.  Snowdrops and sweetgrass
grow in abundance along the trail's sides, brightening the dirt track by
quite a bit.  Travel to the north and south looks to be more trouble than
it's worth, considering the dense bramble and thorned bushes.  The dull roar
of moving water comes from the east, growing increasingly louder the further
east one goes.

From the east a sound very much like that produced by rushing water can
be heard, a constant companion of this forest trail.  Numerous spiky plants
grow under the trees that hem this east to west track in, almost like nature
has conspired to keep you at this point.  Under some of these painful
looking plants, it is possible to make out tiny snowdrops which flourish in
this safe environment.

Branches twist together high overhead, a mingling of purple and green
leaves from both cherry and plum trees creating a colorful canopy.  Hints of
their fruit lay scattered over the ground, strangely left by the birds in
the area to rot and waste away.  The path is well-beaten, though signs of
recent travel are rather scarce over its muddy surface.  Ferns and fungi
fight over which one will have a rotting tree trunk as its host, the orange
and green clashing.

Trees hem in this seldom used trail, their gnarled limbs stretching out over

Brambles line the path, thorny guardians of the seemingly ancient forest 
that surrounds this area and preventing all but the starving from attempting 
to gather mushrooms that cling to the trunks of the trees.  The scent of 
decaying leaf matter hangs heavily in the air, intermixing with the more 
pleasant aroma of wildflowers.

A narrow trail works between ancient trees here, lush grasses plentiful upon 
its earthen surface.  The gnarled branches of the surrounding trees meet 
over this meandering pathway, creating an almost cathedral like feeling to 
the area.  Under the canopy of the forest grow innumerable small shrubs many 
of which belong to the bramble family by the looks of their vicious sharp 
thorns.  These plants make wandering off this east-west trail problematic, 
to say the least.

Gentle waters of the cool blue ocean lap at the base of the cliff to the
north that is curving gently to the west, creating an unobtrusive sound that
has its own relaxing quality.  At the very top of the bluff, the edges of a
forest can be seen, the green contrasting quite vividly with the brown rock
it sits atop of.  The sea continues on to the south and east until it melds
with the horizon, the azure broken only by the occasional vessel travelling
upon it.

south, east, and west and a few vessels of different sizes can be made out
on the horizon.

Sea of Neru~
Rolling waves peak and trough all around and are sending forth the scent

movements of the sea have a serenity to themselves which is only broken by
the harsh calls of high flying sea gulls that seem to gaze down upon your
maritime efforts with contempt.  In the distance dark shapes can be
perceived, though their nature can not be determined from this vantage

east, the cliff line slopes down until it meets the beaches the sea's water
laps over constantly.

A river can be seen to the north, dumping its muddy contents into the sea
with a noted laziness.  The level land that the river travels through
gradually builds up to high cliffs and bluffs further to the west.  To the
east, a wall of rock stops the progress of this ocean, at least for a few
thousand years.  The azure sea stretches away in the other directions, its
surface flinting in any available natural light.

person so that their entrails will become offerings to the ocean.  The rocks
rise steadily out of the waters to the north, becoming what would seem to be
a high rock face in that direction while to the west and south the sea
stretches away, soft wave rippling over each other into the distance.

Sea of Neru~
The continual motions of the sea conjure forth a sound like no other. 
Waves cascade upon waves in a constant rhythm, driven by some unseen force
which sends forth spray heavenwards and fills the air with the energizing
scent of this marine world.  Circling high in the sky is an albatross,
judging by its long yellow bill, black top wing feathers and pale under
plumage, as well as its size.  This avian is a clear indication that land
can not be too far off.

The harmonic sound of one wave caressing the next resonates from all

some nautical vessel it can not really be discerned from this far-off

Sea of Neru~
The Sea of Discord stretches for what seems like forever in all
directions.  It is easy to lose your bearings.  The water is crisp blue and
melts into the skyline on a sunny day.  Huge swells of water rock you gently
as you move along the water.  The shore of land awaits you to the south.

As far as the eye can see, the ocean stretches away.  Its sky-blue waters
seemingly ripple at a distance, though this illusion is dispelled with a

smudges.

Along the Coast~
Low rocks protrude from the waters, deadly for those traversing the sea
but failing to impede the movement of the ocean's waters from reaching the
sandy shore.  Over the sands, a dense mass of vines and trees can be
discerned which looks all but impenetrable from this distance, over the top
of which a peak can be seen that has a spiral of smoke rising from it.  To
the east and south, open waters are visible and the tang of salt is a
constant presence because of this.

A Jungle-lined Coast~
The scenery changes drastically here: the bluffs to the north do not
continue on to the west.  Instead, level land becomes more apparent, covered
in a dense jungle all the way to its raised coastline.  Over the tropical
growth, a monolithic mountain rises far into the distance, giving off a
steady stream of smoke.  The sea is shallow here, following a shelf of sand
that the low tides never seem to bare.  To the south and the east, the ocean
continues on in a shimmering bright blue mass.

The Docks of Tortuguero~
A wooden jetty stretches out into the sea here, the wood bleached by the
sun, wind, rain and sea so that it is grey instead of whatever color it was
before.  It still looks like it could support a significant weight, despite
its weathered state.  Moored upon the north and south side of these docks
are a pair of vessels: to the north, there is a small ship and to the south
a fishing boat, by the looks of them.  To the east, sits the azure ocean,
its surface in constant motion.

Nearing a Port~
The peninsula to the northwest is edged in golden sand that wraps around
from its start around the tip to the docks found at the immediate west.  A
town can be detected past the sand and docking area, though it is uncertain
of the total size or the nature due to the jungle screening it.  Over the
dense foliage and vine growth, a mountain peak rises far above the plant
life at some distance to the north.  The blue ocean continues to the east
and south, only broken by the occasional smudge at the horizon that marks a
passing vessel.  A few boats are moving through this area, clearly intending
to stop at this port.

Sea of Neru~
Salt spray fills the air as a wave falls down upon one of its brethren,
spume is cast forth bearing a heavy taint of the salty deeps.  The ocean
possesses a blue coloration similar in color to the sky upon a summer's day,
and this, when considered with the lapping sounds and motions of the sea,
creates an impression of tranquility that could almost be soothing to one's
spirit.  A few dark shapes appear to loom upon the horizon, whether they be
naval vessels or masses of land can not be perceived from this vantage
point.

over the sapphire blue waters clearly for miles.  Specks dot the horizon
though the nature of these blemishes is not apparent.

Rolling waves peak and trough all around and are sending forth the scent
of salt into the air with each movement of their tumult.  The continuous

the harsh calls of high flying sea gulls that seem to gaze down upon your
maritime efforts with contempt.  In the distance dark shapes can be
perceived, though their nature can not be determined from this vantage

The gentle lapping of the waves holds a relaxing quality, lulling to

shapes wheel high overhead and judging by the sounds of their faint calls,
they must be sea gulls though it is unusual for one to descend so that
anyone upon this stretch of water can truly perceive one to be certain. 
Seawater can be seen in all directions, seeming one continuous body of fluid
that is only occasionally broken by a dark shape on the horizon.

The rolling sea stretches off in all directions, its blue-green surface
looking serene and unalterable.  The scent of the ocean continually drifts
upwards from the body of water, inescapable from this position upon it and
forcing a salty tang to fill the lungs and coat one's flesh.  Dark masses
line the horizons, whether this is an optical illusion or something is truly
present can not really be determined at this point.

back onto themselves over and over.  The water possesses a blue tint,
somewhat reminiscent of a summer's sky in color, which also adds to the
serene feel of this area.  Only the aroma of the salt water dispels any
feelings of peace, along with the occasional cry of a distant sea bird

The continual motions of the sea conjure forth a sound like no other. 
Waves cascade upon waves in a constant rhythm, driven by some unseen force
which sends forth spray heavenwards and fills the air with the energizing
scent of this marine world.  Circling high in the sky is an albatross,
judging by its long yellow bill, black top wing feathers and pale under
plumage, as well as its size.  This avian is a clear indication that land
can not be too far off.

Tangled Waves~
It seems almost impossible to make a boat passable in these waters since
the waves dont seem to consist of liquid but rather a slowly moving bed of
tangled seaweed.  These rubbery plants are simply everywhere and have
intertwined themselves to one another.  You do mange to spy a few trickles
of thick green algae coated water seeping through the large and oily leaves,
dispelling your former notions.

sea, looking very likely to cut open either a swimmer of a vessel that
should be silly enough to try an navigate this gauntlet.  To the north and
east, open sea is visible, appearing to stretch away without end.

Sharp rocks rise from the frothing waters here like spear tips of some
angry water tribe, ready to shred boat or swimmer alike.  Spots of coral can
be seen wrapping along the bottoms of the rocks when the unsettled water
clears enough by displacing all the algae floating in it.  Something dark
can be seen along the horizon some distance to the north, its elongated form
marking it as a piece of land.  The blue water of the ocean continues off to
the east, as well, its horizon free of blemish.

Near Jagged Rocks~
Wave upon wave of the ocean's water collides here, sending a spray into
the air as it collides against the jagged rocks that bar travel to the
southwest.  A glance to the north and the south shows that the jagged rocks
continue on for some distance, their menacing structures overgrown with
kelp.  More sea can be seen beyond this strange barrier, but it is barred by
nature.  The blue waters of the sea continue in all other directions and
movement toward the rippling waters seems unhindered.

Close To A Coral Bed~
The harsh call of a sea bird echoes through the air as it circles above
an impassable reef to the southeast, its beady eyes trained upon the coral
for signs of food.  This natural barrier seems to stretch off on the
diagonal to the northeast and southwest from this point, impossible to cross
with either a boat or by swimming.  In the other directions the sea
continues looking calm and clear for as far as the eye can see, though a few

Along the Coral~
Coral of graduating colors blocks passage to both the south and the east,
the structure of which is very thick and must be ancient.  The water breaks
in gentle lapping noises over the top of this natural barrier, sending both
a refreshing spray of sea water and an almost relaxing sound to fill the
air.  The azure waters continue to the north and west, the surface rippling
with activity but seeming relatively calm.

Before A Reef~
Bright coral can be seen just under the water's surface, beautiful in its
own way but lethal to attempt to cross.  The waters lap over the broad reef
bringing the bounty of the ocean to the creatures that thrive within its
shelter.  The scent of the sea is a strong companion as it fills the air all
around, thrown up as a wave breaks upon the obstacle.  Northwards and
westwards, more docile waters stretch away, seemingly endless.

A Coral Reef~
To the southeast, what at first looks eerily like bones can be seen
jutting from the water's surface.  It is only when the movement of the waves
permits that it becomes obvious that this is in fact a coral reef.  Under
the sea's surface the coral looks much more alive, possessing a range of
vivid colors the likes of which are rarely seen in the surface world.  To
the southwest, the sea seems to be gripped by a mighty storm while in all
the other directions it looks to be placid, stretching off into the
distance.

Sea of Neru~
The continual motions of the sea conjure forth a sound like no other. 
Waves cascade upon waves in a constant rhythm, driven by some unseen force
which sends forth spray heavenwards and fills the air with the energizing
scent of this marine world.  Circling high in the sky is an albatross,
judging by its long yellow bill, black top wing feathers and pale under
plumage, as well as its size.  This avian is a clear indication that land
can not be too far off.

Stormy Coast~
The waves slow in their motion, clear of the binding hold of rocks upon
which to break their anger.  Free of the visual impairment of the sea's
thrashing white froth, you can follow the ripples of various aquatic life
which have chosen to travel closer to the broiling surface.  Far beneath the
green wrathful waters there are a number of sculpted white and coral stones
which look to be inhabited by the smaller breeds for shelter.

Sea's Perch~
A single low flat rock stands out from all the others here, its surface
smoothed by the wind and the sea, behind this rock others can be seen but
these appear more like the fangs of some legendary sea monster than a place
to rest.  To the north and east the ocean appears more open and travelable
and all around there is the continuous smell of sea somewhat invigorating to
one's senses, as if it is filled with life.

Stormy Coast~
Nature's fury seems to have been unleashed upon this section of the sea
as waves rise and crash back down with ferocity akin to a wrathful god. 
Hidden in the boiling waters to the east and south are lethal looking rocks
or a coral reef, through which travel at the moment would be impossible due
to the raging winds and trashing waves.  Salt water is thrown all around,
inescapable with the movements of the waves.  Northwards the ocean seems
calmer when compared to here, though this might be a trick of the eye or
mind.

Storm Tossed Waters~
The sea seems to boil even as the sky does the same, waves rise higher
and higher before pounding vengefully downwards once more.  Spume is thrown
heavenwards, its salty tang speaking of the deeps that is has risen from.  A
shiver runs along your spine, almost as if you can sense rather than see
some form of magic at work behind this mighty storm, though no true source
can as yet be determined.  The traitorous sea seems to stretch out in all
directions even if the truth of this matter can no be determined due to the
tempest.

Stormy Coast~
Grey waters crash with a thunderous smack against the rocks that jut out
of the waters at the west.  This spine of brown spear-like rocks looks like
it could destroy ships, let alone people lost within the swift currents that
rage here.  This stone formation of razor points seems to continue its way
in a diagonal from the northwest to the southeast.  The sea becomes more
treacherous as it is churned over and over here, the waves easily sixteen
feet in height.

The Ill Sea~
The dark waves fall upon each other in a boil as they seethe, cursing in
the form; of the harsh, bedewed tongue of an ill-tempered sea.  The wind
swirls about you clamoring in its own violent and rasping voice, contending
to be heard by the ears of one who might appease their temperament.  It
would be wise to leave this place before it decides to works you into it
cacophonous symphony.

In the Shallows of the Bluffs~
The pounding of the sea as it strikes these low cliffs produces a sound
much akin to that of a great storm raging over head, though no storm holds
the lethal rocks that the ocean throws itself against.  Off to the east and
south, the sea stretches away as far as ones eye can see--an endless expanse
of blue only broken near the horizon by an occasional dark shape too small
to see.  Dense plant life throngs the top of these cliffs and from somewhere
inland a sporadic plume of dark smoke can be seen.

slightly when it is illuminated with natural light.  Far below, the water
becomes darker and less definition of shapes can be made out, but the sea
floor is not apparent just yet.  As for here, there are schools of gayly
colored fish swimming about, trying to avoid you as you displace the salt
water in their path.

algae-filled depths of the ocean clear, but one can see the dark shapes of
other creatures swimming further below.

through on the flowing salt water.  The surface to the ocean seems to be
just above, as some dappled light filters from above.

scoops up a handful of the unsuspecting animals and then swims away.  Algae
floats by on the currents that flow through here, bringing a blast of warm
water as it travels along.  Further below, one can barely make out the large
shapes of other creatures moving along.

A short burst of movement disrupts the kelp and fish swimming below you,
sending the living creatures scattering rather abruptly.  It is too dark to
see clearly what caused this fright, however, as the light from the surface
above is too weak to penetrate the algae-laden waters.  The fish soon return
to their normal paths and swim in schools back and forth as they search out
their sustenance.

The buoyant waters of the sea provide a steady resistance to all your
efforts of swimming, the moving water playing with your clothes and hair
alike, moving them as if under a lover's caress.  The water is warm here but
gets colder the deeper one swims, and seems to lose definition in the
depths, as well; the light of the surface world doesn't penetrate very far
into the stygian fluid.

Creatures stir in the depths, hidden both in the relative darkness and

floats by on the currents, littering your submerged body with deposits of
their particles.

be too deep as the light from the surface world penetrates this far.  It

fails to define the contents of the water below, making the swimming shapes
in that depth look like little more than wiggling masses of darkness.

Under the Sea~
A few strands of seaweed climbs toward the light from the depths below,
the bed of kelp tickling any skin that comes in contact with.  The currents
that run through the grass of the sea make them move like hair when it is
submerged in water.  The light from above is not enough to make the
algae-filled depths of the ocean clear, but one can see the dark shapes of
other creatures swimming further below.

Under the Sea~
Bubbles of air come from the depths of the ocean below, following a
stirring of something large.  Schools of fish with bright red, yellow, and
white markings swim at speed through the water here, their slim finned
bodies wiggling with an otherworldly grace.  Algae and brine shrimp float
through on the flowing salt water.  The surface to the ocean seems to be
just above, as some dappled light filters from above.

Under the Sea~
The water shimmers above and partially lights this area, allowing one a
plain view of hordes of tetra fish swimming in schools.  If you watch these
strange clear-bodied fish longer, a larger silvery fish comes along and
scoops up a handful of the unsuspecting animals and then swims away.  Algae
floats by on the currents that flow through here, bringing a blast of warm
water as it travels along.  Further below, one can barely make out the large
shapes of other creatures moving along.

Under the Sea~
A short burst of movement disrupts the kelp and fish swimming below you,
sending the living creatures scattering rather abruptly.  It is too dark to
see clearly what caused this fright, however, as the light from the surface
above is too weak to penetrate the algae-laden waters.  The fish soon return
to their normal paths and swim in schools back and forth as they search out
their sustenance.

Under the Sea~
The buoyant waters of the sea provide a steady resistance to all your
efforts of swimming, the moving water playing with your clothes and hair
alike, moving them as if under a lover's caress.  The water is warm here but
gets colder the deeper one swims, and seems to lose definition in the
depths, as well; the light of the surface world doesn't penetrate very far
into the stygian fluid.

Under the Sea~
Creatures stir in the depths, hidden both in the relative darkness and
the masses of plant life that flourish here.  Schools of bright fish swim in
concert to and fro, the light from above flashing off their smooth, scaled
bodies in vibrant yellow, red, and snowy white.  Algae mixed with shrimp
floats by on the currents, littering your submerged body with deposits of
their particles.
