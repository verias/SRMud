Inyan's blue eyes glow with intelligence and concentration as he polishes
a small silver piece for one of his items.  His sleek white fur is properly

paws for work.

Yalias~
Yalias~
Yalias reclines with a sword across her hind legs, sizing you up with a twitch of an ear.
~
This Sitya's eyes miss absolutely nothing.  The slitted pupils seem to drink
in everything.  They swim within irises so sharply blue they seem to prickle
like dry ice.  Her fur is quite well groomed, yet it shows evidence of the
scars that lie beneath.  This magnificent cat is almost purely muscle and 
claw.

Sitya mist cat~
a Sitya~
A mysterious cat-like creature becomes a shapeless misty form as it moves.
~
This is a magnificent cat-like creature with intense eyes and a long
sleek tail.  Its fur is impeccably groomed and smoothed.  Long whiskers
shoot from either side of a small black nose.  When at rest, the Sitya is
easily defined as cat-like however, when on the move it appears to be more
of a wisp of mist with eyes.

A wisp of mist flows fluidly through the trees.  At times, when it moves
slowly, it appears to have the start of a form.  Amazingly, the mist appears
to have a pair of large piercing eyes.  When it spies some prey it stands
perfectly still, readying to pounce.  At that time it looks like a large
powerful cat.

Ayana, the village cook, slinks through the dining hall.
~
The years have crippled old Ayana.  Her hind leg drags just a bit as she
moves about her dining hall.  She is responsible for preparing the fresh
meat brought to her by the hunters.  Most days she serves it raw, seasoned
with a few pungent herbs.  She takes care to keep herself impeccably
groomed.  Sometimes she has to ask the aid of one of the younger Sitya in
order to reach the spot halfway down her spine.

ray ice~
An Ice Ray~
A large ray glides through the ice here.
~
Before you is a large ice ray.  Ice rays and ocean going rays look almost
exactly the same, other than slight color variations and specially crafted
gills.  This ray is no exception to that rule.  The ray in front of you is
large and completely white.  It has a long tail and a wingspan of nearly 10
feet across.  Although its teeth are razor sharp, their position in the Rays
mouth is rather ungainly for combat with large opponents, so the animals
primary defense is its sting.  The ray, at the moment, seems rather calm,
and barely notices you as you pass.

{xIyaras was once a well respected citizen of Sityana.  Several years
ago, he began acting erratically.  He is quite mad now and will attack
anything that gets within reach.  The Sitya elders don't allow him into the
village since he was responsible for the death of one of the holy Taya
trees.  He is a very long Sitya, with a {yyellow{x and {Wwhite{x
{ys{Wt{yr{Wi{yp{We{yd{x coat which is not very well groomed.  Large fur
balls hang from his tail.  One eye has been scarred shut from so many
battles.

his current body than he ever was when he was normal.  Because he is not
flesh, he has no need of clothes, and therefore doesn't use equipment, but
you can tell that his frozen body is much greater than any normal armor.  He
looks at you now as he looks at every mortal being, with hatred blazing in
cold, clear eyes.

~
Yaliya is a fairly young Sitya, barely out of adolescence.  He has a
reputation for laziness but he cares little.  While the other young Sitya
were training as hunters or warriors, Yaliya was always to be found napping
or playing tricks on the older Sitya.  He is tall, even for a Sitya with a
dark brown coat and piercing green eyes.  He keeps his long claws sharp and
buffed and is occasionally found picking a scrap with his customers. 
Besides fighting, gambling is his next favorite past-time.

the soil while planting.  She'd rather not be disturbed, preferring the
company of plants to other sorts of creatures.

his mind is still sharp.  He works lovingly with the prized felidae to make
some of the finest armor in the land.

with purpose.  Occasionally, a whisper is heard but it's impossible to
determine the direction of it's source.  A tall ancient tree grows solidly
here and around its base grow many bright beautiful flowers that scent the
air charmingly.  Branches grow spiral up the tree as though they were a

A misty pond~
A dark, still pond stretches to the south until it disappears into the
mist.  No ripples disturb the mirror-like surface above which hangs a thick
mist.  Barely audible whispers seem to seep from every direction although no
forms of any kind can be seen.  The air is cold and damp making everything
feel heavy.  Droplets fall randomly from above, as if from condensation
collecting on a thousand surfaces.  It is somehow different than the

Before a great mist-shrouded oak~
At the edge of a clearing is certainly one of the largest oak trees in
existence.  The thick bark has deep cracks running along it where the trunk
has outgrown it's woody skin.  Looking up, you can't see past the lowest
immense branches due to the thick fog which seems concentrated in this tree,
almost as if hiding something from view.

Among the Enslaved Human Dead~
The filth here is staggering.  The smell of decay and despair permeates
the air.  Misery hangs here like a heavy damp blanket.  This is the pen
where the human dead are kept until their service is required.  Although
there are no physical barriers the slaves here are surely confined.  No
walls, nor bars can be seen.  Near the edges of the clearing the air seems

moonlight.  The affect is magnified by the warmer atmosphere of the area due
to the resident Tineers, and the soft ground feels like grass under your
feet.  There is little smell of fungus, and the only noises you hear are
those of the crunching of grass under your feet.

spiraling stairs stand in the south eastern corner leading up to the second
floor.  A large wooden table stands in the center of the room, lightly
padded chairs set neatly under it.  Sky blue curtains flank the two windows
set either side of the northern door.

them, and some of the pegs have helmets or cloaks on them.  There are runes

from which there is snow gushing forth.  It is just big enough for you to
fit through.

of destruction.  All around you the ice is shattered and broken, leaving
razor sharp shards laying all over the floor.  Whatever it was that caused
this must have been powerful compared to the rest of the creatures in these
caves.  All that remains of it is a hole into the darkness.

into the cold blackness of a large gaping drain.  As you near the bottom of
this cold watery grave you hear a slightly manic, sinister giggle.  The last
image you see is that of a blond human male leaning over the edge of the
drain.  He giggles, adjusts his glasses and watches you with keen interest.

Beneath a Taya Tree~
The ground is cluttered with fallen leaves, golden and shimmering, but still
with a slightly green tone, even though they may have lain here for years.
A tree with thick twisting boughs shades the area, yet still much sunlight
filters through.  There is, however, one large patch of shade speckled with
colored light filtering through the windows of a building suspended in the
Taya tree.  The building is not accessible from here, as the lowest branch is
still too high to reach, but you can see bridges leading to it above you.
There appears to be some sort of door cleverly worked into the tree.

elongated hearts emitting a sweet relaxing smell.  The only sound that reaches
into the center of the enclave, past the curtain of young tendril branches, is
the soft rustling of those tiny leaves.  Yet as you look up you see the larger
branches of the Taya tree curling upwards with tangled arms and bearing huge
heart leaves--a sign of the mature limb.

The path meanders generally east through the small forest of Taya trees.  
Looking around, the fact of the forest seems fairly amazing.  Beyond the last
limbs of the great trees, the bushes become so tangled and prickly that no
one could possibly pass through into this sheltered village by any path
other than the main entrance.  Yet this small area is carefully clear of 
almost everything but the trunks of the Taya trees and a few bushes.  Above

The moss splits into two paths for a moment here, carefully circling a
small Taya sapling growing in the exact center of a circle formed by the two
paths.  There are two long curved logs of Taya wood carved carefully into
benches on the outside of the moss circle, providing a very pretty resting
spot or a perfect place for the tenders of the sapling to monitor its
growth.  The sapling is only about one foot tall, and its tiny branches are
still mostly curved downwards, not yet twisting upwards in the never-ending
dance of the Taya tree with the sky.

a perfect circle, and upon entering it a feel of peace settles within your

Two Taya trees stand majestically here, growing so close together that at

Entering the ring of forget-me-nots causes all your worries about your

past and the future seem to become much more important to you.  This moment
seems trivial.  The flowers dance a circle pattern before your eyes, showing
you your own patterns, and perhaps ways to break free of them.  You don't
feel guilt, or regret, just thoughtfulness.  These reminders, these past
occurrences, ease into your mind softly but do not bring emotion.  In the

Like a gentle pattering of rain, hundreds of tiny leaves are falling about
you. A Taya tree growing near you has begun to reach maturity and no longer
grows the branches that fall downwards with tiny leaves.  From now on, it will
only grow strong upward branches.  At this time, the tree sheds the remaining
of the juvenile Taya leaves.  The leaves are small elongated hearts that have
turned almost silver before dropping off the newly mature tree.  They each
float gently to the ground, making the moss look like it has been cast in

By a Taya Tree growing in the pond~
The roots of the Taya tree drink deeply from the warm spring water creating
this pond.  Some of those roots twist up out of the water for a time, but
the ends are always completely submerged.  The great tree finds purchase for
it's bulk in the floor of the only somewhat shallow pond, yet still reaches
about the same height up as the other Taya trees in the village.  The 
entire pond seems to pulse with energy, despite the fact that it is as still
as a mirror, reflecting endlessly the canopy above.  The energy seems to 
emanate from the tree itself, almost glowing in the mists.

Among the roots of an immense Taya Tree~
The size of this huge tree towering above you could dwarf even the tallest
elf. It is so vastly wide that from this distance it would take up the 
entirety of the sharpest cat's sight.  And yet despite the overwhelming size, 
it emits a feeling of peace, of endurance, and of welcoming to the least
traveller that might wander through here.  It has a hugely ornate door carved
into the side of it, with scenes of Sityan divinity in bass relief upon them.
All about the edges of the door are painted colorful Sityan runes.  The
handles to the door are made of silver and wrought in the likeness of Taya 
leaves. There are delicate stained glass windows on either side of the doors.

In a mossy circle of Taya saplings~
There is something transcendent about this clearing at the edge of the
village of Sityana.  The amazing feeling of something holy permeates the
entire grove of saplings.  There are ten small saplings here, each about
four feet tall.  They completely enclose this area, giving a sense of
solitude to any who come here to worship.  Each tree has been ever so
carefully nourished.  This clearing is something of a miracle to the Sitya. 
Taya saplings are so rare, to have so many at once is a definite miracle. 
Part of the reason is quite clear, there is a very large stump in the center
of the circle.  The stump has become worn from being used as a place to
meditate and pray.  It has a raised part that is carved into an altar,
covered in the holy symbols of the Sitya.  The hole in the foliage above
that came from the sacrifice of this grand tree allowed the sun to come in
and gently caress each sapling to flourish and grow.

greens, muted browns and misty whites of the rest of Sityana.  Poppies
compete with irises that dance about sunflowers which tower over anemones
and many other flowers besides those.  The smells are wonderful, sweet and
delicate.  A smattering of clean cut stems are mute testament to the love of
the villagers for fresh flowers in their homes.

Shaded by a Taya Tree~
The canopy above you is so dense with large Taya leaves and the last of the
small Taya leaves on this newly mature tree that very little light filters 
down to the ground here.  Above you you hear the sounds of life.  Birds sing 
sweetly of summer days and spring eggs.  Squirrels chatter of hidden stashes
of nuts.  A gentle purring seems to emanate from the tree itself.

Gadgyets~
This shop has been carved out of the living trunk of a Taya tree.  The
walls are the living grain of the tree, almost white and polished to a
shine.  There are shelves carved into the walls, each with symbols carefully
scratched beneath them, and lots of twisted tangly odds and ends that you
can't identify sitting on them.  A rope ladder leads up, possibly even
deeper into the tree.

The Fairy Circle~
This quaint tea house is tiny, yet comfortable.  Low round tables are
spaced just far enough apart to allow easy conversation between the
occupants of each.  Fine cups, formed from supple Taya leaves adhered to
woven willow branches, are placed in front of each customer at the table.  A
small, rope ladder leads up, into the tree.  The door leads out to the south
to well manicured paths.  In the north wall is a round frame, From some
angles the center of the frame looks like a mirror.  When looked at straight
on, flashes of light can be seen darting to and fro.

The North Spar~
The northernmost Taya tree in this grove is one of the largest.  Several
low tables are placed around a circular bar in the center.  A tiny glowing
orb sits in the center of each table casting a low light.  The mood in here
is festive.  Sitya of all ages gather here to enjoy good food, good drink,
and bawdy company.  Ale is served in shallow bowls which are then tossed by
the customers into a large pile along the back wall.  A rope ladder leads
up, further into the tree.

This is a cluttered shop with stacks of paintings in spectacular Taya

side of the room.  Arranged neatly along it's length are small statues
carved from glowing Taya wood.  Each is warmly shined and affixed onto a
heavy wooden base.  Hanging on the walls are intricate tapestries, most
showing Sitya in fantastical situations.  On either side of the door, which
leads out to the north, are life-sized carvings of Sitya.  On a shelf behind
the long counter are several small bowls containing brightly colored gems.

Sityan Temple~
The sheer size of the opening in this great tree is awe inspiring. 
Amazingly, the tree appears to be living, despite the fact that it is
hollow.  The temple is lit by what look like a thousand tiny flames.  They
float randomly, gently reversing their direction with a bounce off the
walls.  A large shallow bowl made of some shimmering iridescent metal sits
on a wooden dias.  Emanating from the bowl is a wisp of piquant smoke.  A
pile of sacred Taya leaves are kept smoldering here.  Sityan runes are
painted in silver paint along the inner walls of the hollow tree.  A sturdy
rope ladder leads up, further into the tree.

This shop is bathed in a strange, magical light, which seems to originate
from the smooth living walls of the Taya tree.  Spheres of various sizes and
colors float randomly near the top of the room.  A musical tinkling sound
comes from the spheres.  A large wicker cage containing brightly colored
butterflies rests on the dirt floor.  The air nearly crackles with powerful
magic.  Several baskets line the walls, some containing wands engraved with
strange runes, others containing vials of potions.  The room is nearly
perfectly round, with no exits save the rope ladder which leads up into the
strong arms of the tree.

Sylvan Greens~
The light is as bright as sunlight in here, and it seems to emanate from the
very walls.  Although it didn't appear to be anything other than a mere Taya
tree on the outside, if a Taya tree can ever be called to be merely anything,
from the inside this tree appears to be a greenhouse, allowing as much
light in as possible, and perhaps even augmenting it.  Perhaps these trees
can do quite a bit more than normal trees.  The hollow trunk feels like a 
greenhouse as well, the air is humid and warm and smells quite green.  There
are plants on long tables and shelves on the walls, making it feel as if there
is a jungle inside this tree.  The flowers are incredibly vivid, and the greens
look quite tasty.

out of a ball of thick moss which serves as a type of pincushion.  A rope

Fallen Axe~
The shopkeeper here seems to take pride in offering a wide variety of
weapons to his customers.  It seems that every kind of weapon imaginable is
hanging on large wooden pegs in the walls.  Metal blades and axe-heads catch
the natural light of the Taya wood and are nearly blinding in their
brightness.  Sityan runes are etched above each weapon along with what looks
like a price.  The more expensive weapons are also inscribed with Sityan
runes along the handles and even etched in the metal.  An open doorway leads
out to the south to a shop that appears to have much armor on display.

The Caterwaul~
The gentle metallic ringing of claws on metal strings drifts through the air,
relaxing even the most high strung visitor to this shop.  The reason is
obvious, the time it must have taken to carefully carve and craft the 
instruments racked on the walls is absolutely astounding.  There are all
varieties of instruments, including some unidentifiable by any but a Sitya,
yet they are predominantly string instruments.  After all, claws make the 
perfects picks, but sharp teeth can do terrible things to mouthpieces.  The
inside of this tree has been perfectly tuned for the music to reverberate with
incredible intensity.

Thick brown ropes are woven between the buildings and a boardwalk as if
spun by some great spider.  Obviously, the pathway was designed by creatures
of great intelligence.  No handrails are provided and one must move on all
fours.  The ropes are spaced closely enough to allow movement without much
danger of falling onto the moss and gardens below.  To the east the rope web
is attached to a thin boardwalk formed from short planks.  To the north and

trees in the grove.  It consists of two stories with the bare branch of the

series of bumps in the branch used for a stairway which facilitates movement
from one level to the next.  A rocking bench, which has been draped with a
thick afghan takes up much of the center of the room.  Windows are set into
each wall and a skylight allows one to look out to the top of the Taya

This particular one is triangular.  The boardwalk continues to the north and

A friendly home in the arms of two Taya trees~
This is one of the smaller homes in Sityana but it seems to glow with
warmth.  It has two doors which are always open.  Most Sitya feel
comfortable just stopping by for a visit before or after a meal at the
dining hall to the north.  There is a door which leads out to the west onto
a large platform.  Large windows are carved into the remaining two walls
making for a well lit and cheerful room.  Long fluffy, stuffed mats are
lined against every bit of wall space.  Many visitors can sit here at one
time.

This home is full of rainbows.  They arch in every direction and flash
off the walls.  Nearly the entire ceiling is an open window with a grid of
thin wooden strips running across it.  From the grid hang hundreds of
faceted crystals, each acting as a prism for the sunlight or moonlight that
finds it's way through the Taya canopy.  The door leads out to the north
onto a wooden platform.  There are windows scattered, seemingly randomly,
across all of the walls.  Hanging in each window is a large, highly cut
crystal.  The rainbows from these crystals seem to reinforce each other
making on particularly large and brilliant arch in the center of the room.

A severe home in the arms of a Taya tree~
This is one of the few buildings in Sityana in which everything is built
at right angles.  It rests in the arms of one of the great Taya trees.  The
walls are made of carefully planed boards.  On the floor, a thick carpet of
moss is kept carefully trimmed.  A window set squarely in the north wall
looks out into the deep mists.  A large chair with squared corners sits in

This is a spacious home with thick, comfortable furnishings.  The north
wall is formed from the bare branches of two Taya trees that are interwoven
creating a wide solid structure.  The uneven surface of the back wall gives
a wrinkled appearance.  Natural cubby-holes in the spaces where the two arms
meet hold the treasures of whoever inhabits this home.  The most striking

for some long creature due to the fact that the edges are more elevated than

This large, spacious living room is obviously built in the arms of a
strong tree, as you can see pieces of them cutting through corners and
walls.  Long light coloured wooden planks line the floor and is sparsely
covered with the odd brightly coloured rug here and there.  Against the
northern wall a large stone fire place has been built of rosy coloured
stones, over compensating for its wooden surroundings to ensure no fire
spreads.  A set of large glass double doors lead to the east, and as the
airy white material of the curtains billow softly in the room, you get a
peek of a large wooden balcony.  Each wall is set with many large windows,
covered with the same curtains as the double doors, which also billow in the
room from the constant cooling breeze running around the room.  Set
nondescriptly in the south-western corner of the room is a small ladder
leading up to another room.

double doors to the west.  Little flower boxes line along the railing of the
balcony, spilling bright colours down the side and filling the air with a
beautiful scent.  You can see far over the forest to the north, east and
south from here, and in the near distance to the east, you can catch a

cabinets match the panelling of the floor, brightening the room even more. 
Looking out any of the windows, you can see far over the Forest of Mists,
feeling like you're actually on top of a cloud.  Peace and serenity fill
you.  A small opening in the floor in the south-western corner of the room
has a ladder which leads down to the living room.
