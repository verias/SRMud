	To make this thing work :

	1) Get Rom24b6.tar.gz from Russ Taylor's homepage...this won't
	   work on any other version. I REPEAT, THIS WON'T WORK
	   WITH ANY OTHER VERSION.

	2) Uncompress it, and copy patch.olc into Rom24/src .

	3) cd to Rom24/src, and do a 'patch < patch.olc' .

	4) Copy all the .c and .h files from this distribution to
	   Rom24/src .

	4) Now do a 'make', READ THE ROM FAQ and pray :)
	   Ignore any warnings.

	5) Copy olc.hlp to the Rom24/area directory and add the dummy
	   object that's in the file limbo.are in this distribution
	   to the limbo.are that comes with Rom24.
	
	6) Create two directories : Rom24/data and Rom24/data/progs.
	   (mkdir Rom24/data && mkdir Rom24/data/progs)

	7) Run the mud. It should NOT coredump.
	   Edit the Makefile and remove -DFIRST_BOOT.

	8) Delete your .o files (rm *.o) and recompile.

	9) Load the mud, create a character and quit.

	10) Find this line in your pfile : (Rom24/player/your-name)

	   Sec 0

	   And replace it with:

	   Sec 9

	   This will set your security to the highest possible.
	   Set your level to 60 too.

        10) Now, just get into the mud again and enjoy a not-so-buggy OLC :)

	Try these commands:
	olcx			// enable OLC Vt100 extensions (buggy)
	redit			// edit rooms
	medit 3011		// edit Hassan
	oedit 3001		// Modify obj 3001
	skedit armor		// edit armor spell
	etc...

	Check the command.h file.

	If you use this you MUST send me a postcard. (well, you don't
	have to, but it will make me happy :). I've put a lot of effort
	on this, and I think I deserve a postcard at least :D

	(16/3/2000) Well, noone sent me anything. Argh.

	Most of the new editors are hacks of Erwin's excellent
	social editor (I think the URL is http://www.andreasen.org)

	This works almost perfectly in my linux box at home so you
	should not have any problems compiling it. Sorry for the
	(nonexistant) helpfiles but I hate writing in english.
	If you have any problems, comments, or advise,
	just mail me :)
	Don't mail the ROM list with any problems related with
	compiling this, mail me instead. I'll try to help.
	Don't ask me for english translations of some of the messages
	that you'll find in the code, ask anyone else (learn spanish!).

	Check the NEW OLC-FAQ :D

	And, of course, read the ROM FAQ!
